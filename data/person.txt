To the Reader
T ho ugh it  sh o c k s m e  so m e w h a t  to sa y so, I have been a psycho­
therapist (or personal counselor) for more than thirty-three years. 
This means that during a period of a third of a century I have been 
trying to be of help to a broad sampling of our population: to chil­
dren, adolescents and adults; to those with educational, vocational, 
personal and marital problems; to “ normal,” “ neurotic,” and “psy­
chotic” individuals (the quotes indicate that for me these are all 
misleading labels); to individuals who come for help, and those 
who are sent for help; to those whose problems are minor, and to 
those whose lives have become utterly desperate and without hope. 
I regard it as a deep privilege to have had the opportunity to know 
such a diverse multitude of people so personally and intimately.
Out of the clinical experience and research of these years 1
 have 
written several books and many articles. The papers in this volume 
are selected from those I have written during the most recent 
ten of the thirty-three years, from 1951 to 1961. I would like to 
explain the reasons that I have for gathering them into a book.
In the first place I believe that almost all of them have relevance 
for personal living in this perplexing modern world. This is in no 
sense a book of advice, nor does it in any way resemble the “ do- 
it-yourself’ treatise, but it has been my experience that readers of 
these papers have often found them challenging and enriching. 
They have to some small degree given the person more security 
in making and following his personal choices as he endeavors to 
move toward being the person he would like to be. So for this 
reason I should like to have them more widely available to any

T o  t h e  R e a d e r
vii
who might be interested—to “ the intelligent layman,” as the phrase 
goes. I feel this especially since all of my previous books have been 
published for the professional psychological audience, and have 
never been readily available to the person outside of that group. 
It is my sinccrc hope that many people who have no particular 
interest in the field of counseling or psychotherapy will find that 
the learnings emerging in this field will strengthen them in their 
own living. It is also my hope and belief that many people who 
have never sought counseling help will find, as they read the ex­
cerpts from the recorded therapy interviews of the many clients 
in these pages, that they are subtly enriched in courage and self 
confidence, and that understanding of their own difficulties will 
become easier as they live through, in their imagination and feel­
ing, the struggles of others toward growth.
Another influence which has caused me to prepare this hook is 
the increasing number and urgency of requests from those who are 
already acquainted with my point of view in counseling, psycho­
therapy, and interpersonal relationships. They have made it known 
that they wish to he able to obtain accounts of my more recent 
thinking and work in a convenient and available package. They are 
frustrated by hearing of unpublished articles which they cannot 
acquire; by stumbling across papers of mine in out-of-the-way 
journals; they want them brought together. This is a flattering 
request for any author. It also constitutes an obligation which I have 
tried to fulfill. I hope that they will be pleased with the selection I 
have made. Thus in this respect this volume is for those psycholo­
gists, psychiatrists, teachers, educators, school counselors, religious 
workers, social workers, speech therapists, industrial leaders, labor- 
management specialists, political scientists and others who have in 
the past found my work relevant to their professional efforts. In 
a very real sense, it is dedicated to them.
There is another motive which has impelled me, a more complex 
and personal one. This is the search for a suitable audience for 
what I have to say. For more than a decade this problem has puzzled 
me. I know that I speak to only a fraction of psychologists. The 
majority—their interests suggested by such terms as stimulus-re- 
sponse, learning theory, operant conditioning—are so committed to

viii
T o  t h e  R e a d e r
seeing the individual solely as an object, that what I have to say 
often baffles if it does not annoy them. I also know that I speak to 
but a fraction of psychiatrists. For many, perhaps most of them, the 
truth about psychotherapy has already been voiced long ago by 
Freud, and they are uninterested in new possibilities, and uninter­
ested in or antagonistic to research in this field. I also know that I 
speak to but a portion of the divergent group which call themselves 
counselors. The bulk of this group are primarily interested in pre­
dictive tests and measurements, and in methods of guidance.
So when it comes to the publication of a particular paper, I have 
felt dissatisfied with presenting it to a professional journal in any 
one of these fields. I have published articles in journals of each of 
these types, but the majority of my writings in recent years have 
piled up as unpublished manuscripts, distributed privately in mimeo­
graphed form. They symbolize my uncertainty as to how to reach 
whatever audience it is I am addressing.
During this period journal editors, often of small or highly 
specialized journals, have learned of some of these papers, and have 
requested permission to publish. I have always acceded to these re­
quests, with the proviso that I might wish to publish the paper else­
where at some later time. Thus the majority of the papers I have 
written during this decade have been unpublished, or have seen the 
light of day in some small, or specialized, or off-beat journal.
N ow  however I have concluded that I wish to put these thoughts 
out in book form so that they can seek their own audience. I am 
sure that that audience will cut across a variety of disciplines, some 
of them as far removed from my own field as philosophy and the 
science of government. Yet I have come to believe that the audience 
will have a certain unity, too. I believe these papers belong in a 
trend which is having and will have its impact on psychology, 
psychiatry, philosophy, and other fields. I hesitate to label such a 
trend but in my mind there are associated with it adjectives such as 
phenomenological, existential, person-centered; concepts such as 
self-actualization, becoming, growth; individuals (in this country) 
such as Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow, Rollo May. Hence, 
though the group to which this book speaks meaningfully will, I 
believe, come from many disciplines, and have many wide-ranging

TO THE R f \I)F.R

interests, a common thread may well be their concern about the 
person and his becoming, in a modern world which appears intent 
upon ignoring or diminishing him.
There is one final reason for putting out this book, a motive which 
means a great deal to me. It has to do with the great, in fact the 
desperate, need of our times for more basic knowledge and more 
competent skills in dealing with the tensions in human relationships. 
Man’s awesome scientific advances into the infinitude of space as 
well as the infinitude of sub-atomic particles seems most likely to 
lead to the total destruction of our world unless we can make great 
advances in understanding and dealing with interpersonal and inter- 
group tensions. I feel very humble about the modest knowledge 
which has been gained in this field. I hope for the day when we will 
invest at least the price of one or two large rockets in the search for 
more adequate understanding of human relationships. But I also 
feel keenly concerned that the knowledge we have gained is very 
little recognized and little utilized. I hope it may be clear from this 
volume that we already possess learnings which, put to use, would 
help to decrease the inter-racial, industrial, and international tensions 
which exist. I hope it will be evident that these learnings, used 
preventively, could aid in the development of mature, nondefensive, 
understanding persons who would deal constructively with future 
tensions as they arise. If I can thus make clear to a significant num­
ber of people the unused resource knowledge already available in 
the realm of interpersonal relationships, I will feel greatly rewarded.
So much for my reasons for putting forth this book. Let me 
conclude with a few comments as to its nature. The papers which 
are brought together here represent the major areas of my interest 
during the past decade.* They were prepared for different pur­
poses, usually for different audiences, or formulated simply for my 
own satisfaction. I have written for each chapter an introductory
• The one partial exception is in the area of explicit theory o f personality. 
Having just recently published a complete and technical presentation of my 
theories in a book which should be available in any professional library, I 
have not tried to include such material here. The reference referred to is my 
chapter entitled, “A theory of therapy, personality, and interpersonal relation­
ships as developed in the client-centcred framework” in Koch, S. (ed.) 
Psychology: A Study of a Science, vol. Ill, pp. 184-256. McGraw-Hill, 1959.

note which tries to set the material in an understandable context. 
I have organized the papers in such a way that they portray a unified 
and developing theme from the highly personal to the larger social 
significance. In editing them, I have eliminated duplication, but 
where different papers present the same concept in different ways 
I have often retained these “ variations on a theme” hoping that they 
might serve the same purpose as in music, namely to enrich the 
meaning of the melody. Because of their origin as separate papers, 
each one can be read independently of the others if the reader so 
desires.
Stated in the simplest way, the purpose of this book is to share 
with you something of my experience—something of me. Here is 
what I have experienced in the jungles of modern life, in the largely 
unmapped territory of personal relationships. Here is what I have 
seen. Here is what I have come to believe. Here are the ways I 
have tried to check and test my beliefs. Here are some of the per­
plexities, questions, concerns and uncertainties which I face. I hope 
that out of this sharing you may find something which speaks to 
you.

his chapter combines two very personal talks. Five years ago I 
u'as asked to speak to the senior class at Brandeis University to 
present, not my ideas of psychotherapy, but myself. H ow  had I 
come to think the thoughts 1 had? H ow  bad I come to be the person 
1
 am? I found this a very thought-provoking invitation, and I en­
deavored to meet the request of these students. During this past year 
the Student Union Forum Committee at Wisconsin made a somewhat 
similar request. They asked me to speak in a personal vein on their 
“Last Lecture” series, in which it is assumed that, for reasons un­
specified, the professor is giving his last lecture and therefore giving 
quite personally of himself. (It is an intriguing comment on our 
educational system that it is assumed that only under the most dire 
circumstances would a professor reveal himself in any personal way.) 
In this Wisconsin talk I expressed more f7dly than in the first one the 
personal learnings or philosophical themes which have come to have 
meaning for me. hi the current chapter / have woven together both 
of these talks, trying to retain something of the informal character 
which they had in their initial presentation.
The response to each of these talks has made me realize how hun­

gry people are to know something of the person •who is speaking to 
them or teaching them. Consequently I have set this chapter first in 
the book in the hope that it •will convey something of me, and thus 
give more context and meaning to the chapters which follovj.

I
 h a v e b e e n  in f o r m e d  that what I am expected to do in speaking 
to this group is to assume that m y topic is “ This is Me.” I feel 
various reactions to such an invitation, but one that I would like to 
mention is that I feel honored and flattered that any group wants, in 
a personal sense, to know who I am. I can assure you it is a unique 
and challenging sort of invitation, and I shall try to give to this 
honest question as honest an answer as I can.
So, who am I? I am a psychologist whose primary interest, for 
many years, has been in psychotherapy. W hat does that mean? I 
don’t intend to bore you with a long account of my work, but I 
would like to take a few paragraphs from the preface to my book, 
Client-Centered Therapy, to indicate in a subjective way what it 
means to me. I was trying to give the reader some feeling for the 
subject matter of the volume, and I wrote as follows. “W hat is this 
book about? Let me try to give an answer which may, to some de­
gree, convey the living experience that this book is intended to be.
“ This book is about the suffering and the hope, the anxiety and 
the satisfaction, with which each therapist’s counseling room is filled. 
It is about the uniqueness of the relationship each therapist forms 
with each client, and equally about the common elements which we 
discover in all these relationships. This book is about the highly 
personal experiences of each one of us. It is about a client in my 
office who sits there by the corner of the desk, struggling to be him­
self, yet deathly afraid of being himself — striving to see his experi­
ence as it is, wanting to be that experience, and yet deeply fearful 
of the prospect. This book is about me, as I sit there with that clicnt, 
facing him, participating in that struggle as deeply and sensitively as 
I am able. It is about me as I try to perceive his expcricncc, and the

“ This is M e"
5
meaning and the feeling and the taste and the flavor that it has for 
him. It is about me as I bemoan my very human fallibility in under­
standing that client, and the occasional failures to see life as it ap­
pears to him, failures which fall like heavy objects across the intri­
cate, delicate web of growth which is taking place. It is about me as 
I rejoice at the privilege of being a midwife to a new personality — 
as I stand by with awe at the emergence of a self, a person, as I see a 
birth process in which I have had an important and facilitating part. 
It is about both the client and me as we regard with wonder the 
potent and orderly forces which are evident in this whole experi­
ence, forces which seem deeply rooted in the universe as a whole. 
The book is, I believe, about life, as life vividly reveals itself in the 
therapeutic process — with its blind power and its tremendous 
capacity for destruction, but with its overbalancing thrust toward 
growth, if the opportunity for growth is provided.”
Perhaps that will give you some picture of what I do and the way 
I feel about it. 1 presume you may also wonder how I came to en­
gage in that occupation, and some of the decisions and choices, con­
scious and unconscious, which were made along the way. Let me 
see if I can give you some of the psychological highlights of my 
autobiography, particularly as it seems to relate to my professional 
life.
AIv E a r l y  Y ea rs 
I was brought up in a home marked by close family ties, a very 
strict and uncompromising religious and ethical atmosphere, and 
what amounted to a worship of the virtue of hard work. I came 
along as the fourth of six children. M y parents cared a great deal for 
us, and had our welfare almost constantly in mind. They were also, 
in many subtle and affectionate ways, very controlling of our be­
havior. It was assumed by them and accepted by me that we were 
different from other people — no alcoholic beverages, no dancing, 
cards or theater, very little social life, and much work. I have a 
hard time convincing my children that even carbonated beverages 
had a faintly sinful aroma, and I remember my slight feeling of 
wickedness when I had my first bottle of “pop.” We had good 
times together within the family, but we did not mix. So I was a

6
S pe a k in g  P er so n a lly
pretty solitary boy, who read incessantly, and went all through high 
school with only two dates.
When I was twelve my parents bought a farm and we made our 
home there. The reasons were twofold. M y father, having become 
a prosperous business man, wanted it for a hobby. More important, 
I believe, was the fact that it seemed to my parents that a growing 
adolescent family should be removed from the “temptations” of 
suburban life.
Here I developed two interests which have probably had some 
real bearing on my later work. I became fascinated by the great 
night-flying moths (Gene Stratton-Porter’s books were then in 
vogue) and I became an authority on the gorgeous Luna, Polyphe­
mus, Cecropia and other moths which inhabited our woods. I 
laboriously bred the moths in captivity, reared the caterpillars, kept 
the cocoons over the long winter months, and in general realized 
some of the joys and frustrations of the scientist as he tries to ob­
serve nature.
My father was determined to operate his new farm on a scientific 
basis, so he bought many books on scientific agriculture. He en­
couraged his boys to have independent and profitable ventures of our 
own, so my brothers and I had a flock of chickens, and at one time 
or other reared from infancy lambs, pigs and calves. In doing this I 
became a student of scientific agriculture, and have only realized 
in recent years what a fundamental feeling for science I gained in 
that way. There was no one to tell me that Morison’s Feeds and 
Feeding was not a book for a fourteen-year-old, so I ploughed 
through its hundreds of pages, learning how experiments were con­
ducted— how control groups were matched with experimental 
groups, how conditions were held constant by randomizing proced­
ures, so that the influence of a given food on meat production or 
milk production could be established. I learned how difficult it is 
to test an hypothesis. I acquired a knowledge of and a respect for 
the methods of science in a field of practical endeavor.
C o l l e g e and G r a d u a te E d u c a tio n
I started in college at Wisconsin in the field of agriculture. One 
of the things I remember best was the vehement statement of an

“ This is M e”
7
agronomy professor in regard to the learning and use of facts. He 
stressed the futility of an encyclopedic knowledge for its own sake, 
and wound up with the injunction, “Don’t be a damned ammunition 
wagon; be a rifle!”
During my first two collcge years my professional goal changcd, 
as the result of some emotionally charged student religious confer­
ences, from that of a scientific agriculturist to that of the ministry — 
a slight shift! I changed from agriculture to history, believing this 
would be a better preparation.
In my junior year I was selected as one of a dozen students from 
this country to go to China for an international W orld Student 
Christian Federation Conference. This was a most important experi­
ence for me. It was 1922, four years after the close of W orld W ar I. 
I saw how bitterly the French and Germans still hated each other, 
even though as individuals they seemed very likable. I was forced 
to stretch my thinking, to realize that sincere and honest people 
could believe in very divergent religious doctrines. In major ways 
I for the first time emancipated myself from the religious thinking 
of my parents, and realized that I could not go along with them. 
This independence of thought caused great pain and stress in our 
relationship, but looking back on it I believe that here, more than at 
any other one time, I became an independent person. O f course 
there was much revolt and rebellion in my attitude during that 
period, but the essential split was achieved during the six months I 
was on this trip to the Orient, and hence was thought through away 
from the influence of home.
Although this is an account of elements which influenced my 
professional development rather than my personal growth, I wish 
to mention very briefly one profoundly important factor in my per­
sonal life. It was at about the time of my trip to China that I fell 
in love with a lovely girl whom I had known for many years, even 
in childhood, and we were married, with the very reluctant consent 
of our parents, as soon as I finished college, in order that we could go 
to graduate school together. I cannot be very objective about this, 
but her steady and sustaining love and companionship during all 
the years since has been a most important and enriching factor in 
my life.

8
S p e a k in g P e r so n a l l y
I chose to go to Union Theological Seminary, the most liberal in 
the country at that time (1924), to prepare for religious work. I 
have never regretted the two years there. I came in contact with 
some great scholars and teachers, notably Dr. A. C. McGifTert, who 
believed devoutly in freedom of inquiry, and in following the truth 
no matter where it led.
Knowing universities and graduate schools as I do now — know­
ing their rules and their rigidities — I am truly astonished at one 
very significant experience at Union. A group of us felt that ideas 
were being fed to us, whereas we wished primarily to explore our 
own questions and doubts, and find out where they led. W e peti­
tioned the administration that we be allowed to set up a seminar for 
credit, a seminar with no instructor, where the curriculum would be 
composed of our own questions. The seminary was understandably 
perplexed by this, but they granted our petition! The only restric­
tion was that in the interests of the institution a young instructor was 
to sit in on the seminar, but would take no part in it unless we wished 
him to be active.
I suppose it is unnecessary to add that this seminar was deeply 
satisfying and clarifying. I feel that it moved me a long way toward 
a philosophy of life which was my own. The majority of the mem­
bers of that group, in thinking their way through the questions they 
had raised, thought themselves right out of religious work. I was 
one. I felt that questions as to the meaning of life, and the possibility 
of the constructive improvement of life for individuals, would prob­
ably always interest me, but 1
 could not work in a field where I 
would be required to believe in some specified religious doctrine. 
M y beliefs had already changed tremendously, and might continue 
to change. It seemed to me it would be a horrible thing to have to 
profess a set of beliefs, in order to remain in one’s profession. I 
wanted to find a field in which 1
 could be sure my freedom of 
thought would not be limited.
B ec o m in g  a P sy c h o l o g ist
But what field? I had been attracted, at Union, by the courses 
and lectures on psychological and psychiatric work, which were 
then beginning to develop.

Marian Kenworthy all contributed to this interest. I began to take 
more courses at Teachers’ College, Columbia University, across the 
street from Union Seminary. I took work in philosophy of educa­
tion with William H. Kilpatrick, and found him a great teacher. I 
began practical clinical work with children under Leta Holling- 
worth, a sensitive and practical person. I found myself drawn to 
child guidance work, so that gradually, with very little painful read­
justment, I shifted over into the field of child guidance, and began 
to think of myself as a clinical psychologist. It was a step I eased 
into, with relatively little clearcut conscious choice, rather just fol­
lowing the activities which interested me.
While I was at Teachers’ College I applied for, and was granted 
a fellowship or internship at the then new Institute for Child Guid­
ance, sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund. I have often been 
grateful that I was there during the first year. The organization was 
in a chaotic beginning state, but this meant that one could do what 
he wanted to do. I soaked up the dynamic Freudian views of the 
staff, which included David Levy and Lawson Lowrey, and found 
them in great conflict with the rigorous, scientific, coldly objective, 
statistical point of view then prevalent at Teachers’ College. Look­
ing back, I believe the necessity of resolving that conflict in me was 
a most valuable learning experience. At the time I felt I was func­
tioning in two completely different worlds, “and never the twain 
shall meet.”
By the end of this internship it was highly important to me that 
I obtain a job to support my growing family, even though my doc­
torate was not completed. Positions were not plentiful, and I re­
member the relief and exhilaration I felt when I found one. I was 
employed as psychologist in the Child Study Department of the 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, in Rochester, 
New York. There were three psychologists in this department, and 
my salary was $2,900 per year.
I look back at the acceptance of that position with amusement and 
some amazement. The reason I was so pleased was that it was a 
chance to do the work 1
 wanted to do. That, by any reasonable 
criterion it was a dead-end street professionally, that I would be 
isolated from professional contacts, that the salary was not good

10
S pe a k in g  P e r so n a l l y
even by the standards of that day, seems not to have occurred to 
me, as nearly as I can recall. I think I have always had a feeling that 
if I was given some opportunity to do the thing I was most interested 
in doing, everything else would somehow take care of itself.
T h e R o c h e st e r Y ea rs
The next twelve years in Rochester were exceedingly valuable 
ones. For at least the first eight of these years, I was completely 
immersed in carrying on practical psychological service, diagnosing 
and planning for the delinquent and underprivileged children who 
were sent to us by the courts and agencies, and in many instances 
carrying on “ treatment interviews.” It was a period of relative pro­
fessional isolation, where my only concern was in trying to be more 
effective with our clients. W e had to live with our failures as well 
as our successes, so that we were forced to learn. There was only 
one criterion in regard to any method of dealing with these children 
and their parents, and that was, “Does it work? Is it effective?” I 
found I began increasingly to formulate my own views out of my 
everyday working experience.
Three significant illustrations come to mind, all small, but im­
portant to me at the time. It strikes me that they are all instances 
of disillusionment — with an authority, with materials, with myself.
In my training I had been fascinated by Dr. William Healy’s writ­
ings, indicating that delinquency was often based upon sexual conflict, 
and that if this conflict was uncovered, the delinquency ceased. In 
my first or second year at Rochester I worked very hard with a 
youthful pyromaniac who had an unaccountable impulse to set fires. 
Interviewing him day after day in the detention home, I gradually 
traced back his desire to a sexual impulse regarding masturbation. 
Eureka! The case was solved. However, when placed on probation, 
he again got into the same difficulty.
I remember the jolt I felt. Healy might be wrong. Perhaps I was 
learning something Healy didn’t know. Somehow this incident 
impressed me with the possibility that there were mistakes in authori­
tative teachings, and that there was still new knowledge to discover.
The second naive discovery was of a different sort. Soon after 
coming to Rochester I led a discussion group on interviewing. I

“ This is M e”
11
discovered a published account of an interview with a parent, ap­
proximately verbatim, in which the case worker was shrewd, in­
sightful, clevcr, and led the interview quite quickly to the heart of 
the difficulty. I was happy to use it as an illustration of good inter­
viewing technique.
Several years later, I had a similar assignment and remembered 
this excellent material. I hunted it up again and re-read it. I was ap­
palled. N ow  it seemed to me to be a clever legalistic type of ques­
tioning by the interviewer which convicted this parent of her un­
conscious motives, and wrung from her an admission of her guilt. 
I now knew from my experience that such an interview would not 
be of any lasting help to the parent or the child. It made me realize 
that I was moving away from any approach which was coercive 
or pushing in clinical relationships, not for philosophical reasons, 
but because such approaches were never more than superficially ef­
fective.
The third incident occurred several years later. I had learned to 
be more subtle and patient in interpreting a client’s behavior to 
him, attempting to time it in a gentle fashion which would gain ac­
ceptance. I had been working with a highly intelligent mother 
whose boy was something of a hellion. The problem was clearly 
her early rejection of the boy, but over many interviews I could 
not help her to this insight. I drew her out, I gently pulled to­
gether the evidence she had given, trying to help her see the pattern. 
But we got nowhere. Finally I gave up. I told her that it seemed 
we had both tried, but we had failed, and that we might as well give 
up our contacts. She agreed. So we concluded the interview, shook 
hands, and she walked to the door of the office. Then she turned 
and asked, “Do you ever take adults for counseling here?” When I 
replied in the affirmative, she said, “Well then, I would like some 
help.” She came to the chair she had left, and began to pour out her 
despair about her marriage, her troubled relationship with her hus­
band, her sense of failure and confusion, all very different from the 
sterile “ case history” she had given before. Real therapy began 
then, and ultimately it was very successful.
This incident was one of a number which helped me to experience 
the fact — only fully realized later — that it is the client who knows

12
S p e a k in g P e r so n a lly
what hurts, what directions to go, what problems are crucial, what 
experiences have been deeply buried. It began to occur to me that 
unless I had a need to demonstrate my own cleverness and learning, 
I would do better to rely upon the clicnt for the direction of move­
ment in the process.
P sy c h o l o g ist or

During this period I began to doubt that I was a psychologist. 
The University of Rochester made it clear that the work I was doing 
was not psychology, and they had no interest in my teaching in the 
Psychology Department. I went to meetings of the American Psy­
chological Association and found them full of papers on the learning 
processes of rats and laboratory experiments which seemed to me 
to have no relation to what I was doing. The psychiatric social 
workers, however, seemed to be talking my language, so I becamc 
active in the social work profession, moving up to local and even 
national offices. Only when the American Association for Applied 
Psychology was formed did I become really active as a psychologist.
I began to teach courses at the University on how to understand 
and deal with problem children, under the Department of Sociology. 
Soon the Department of Education wanted to classify these as edu­
cation courses, also. [Before I left Rochester, the Department of 
Psychology, too, finally requested permission to list them, thus at 
last accepting me as a psychologist.] Simply describing these ex­
periences makes me realize how stubbornly I have followed my 
own course, being relatively unconcerned with the question of 
whether I was going with my group or not.
Time does not permit to tell of the work of establishing a separate 
Guidance Center in Rochester, nor the battle with some of the 
psychiatric profession which was included. These were largely ad­
ministrative struggles which did not have too much to do with the 
development of my ideas.
M y  C h ild r e n
It was during these Rochester years that my son and daughter 
grew through infancy and childhood, teaching me far more about 
individuals, their development, and their relationships, than I could

ever have learned professionally. I don’t feel I was a very good par­
ent in their early years, but fortunately my wife was, and as time 
went on I believe / gradually became a better and more understand­
ing parent. Certainly the privilege during these years and later, of 
being in relationship with two fine sensitive youngsters through all 
their childhood pleasure and pain, their adolescent assertiveness and 
difficulties, and on ifito their adult years and the beginning of their 
own families, has been a priceless one. 1
 think my wife and I regard 
as one of the most satisfying achievements in which we have had a 
part, the fact that we can really communicate in a deep way with 
our grown-up children and their spouses, and they with us.
O hio S t a t e Y ea rs
In 1940 I accepted a position at Ohio State University. I am sure 
the only reason I was considered was my book on the Clinical 
Treatment of the Problem Child, which I had squeezed out of va­
cations, and brief leaves of absence. T o  my surprise, and contrary 
to my expectation, they offered me a full professorship. I heartily 
recommend starting in the academic world at this level. I have often 
been grateful that I have never had to live through the frequently 
degrading competitive process of step-by-step promotion in univer­
sity faculties, where individuals so frequently learn only one lesson
— not to stick their necks out.
It was in trying to teach what I had learned about treatment and 
counseling to graduate students at Ohio State University that I first 
began to realize that I had perhaps developed a distinctive point of 
view of my own, out of my experience. When I tried to crystallize 
some of these ideas, and present them in a paper at the University of 
Minnesota in December 1940,1
 found the reactions were very strong. 
It was my first experience of the fact that a new idea of mine, which 
to me can seem all shiny and glowing with potentiality, can to an­
other person be a great threat. And to find myself the center of 
criticism, of arguments pro and con, was disconcerting and made 
me doubt and question. Nevertheless I felt I had something to con­
tribute, and wrote the manuscript of Counseling and Psychotherapy, 
setting forth what I felt to be a somewhat more effective orientation 
to therapy.

14
S pe a k in g  P e r so n a l l y
Here again I realize with some amusement how little I have cared 
about being “ realistic.” When I submitted the manuscript, the pub­
lisher thought it was interesting and new, but wondered what classes 
would use it. I replied that I knew of only two — a course I was 
teaching and one in another university. The publisher felt I had 
made a grave mistake in not writing a text which would fit courses 
already being given. He was very dubious that he could sell 2,000 
copies, which would be necessary to break even. It was only when 
I said I would take it to another publisher that he decided to make 
the gamble. I don’t know which of us has been more surprised at 
its sales — 70,000 copies to date and still continuing.
R e c e n t  Y ears
I believe that from this point to the present time my professional 
life —  five years at Ohio State, twelve years at the University of 
Chicago, and four years at the University of Wisconsin — is quite 
well documented by what I have written. I will very briefly stress 
two or three points which have some significance for me.
I have learned to live in increasingly deep therapeutic relation­
ships with an ever-widening range of clients. This can be and has 
been extremely rewarding. It can be and has been at times very 
frightening, when a deeply disturbed person seems to demand that I 
must be more than I am, in order to meet his need. Certainly the 
carrying on of therapy is something which demands continuing per­
sonal growth on the part of the therapist, and this is sometimes pain­
ful, even though in the long run rewarding.
I would also mention the steadily increasing importance which 
research has come to have for me. Therapy is the experience in 
which I can let myself go subjectively. Research is the experience 
in which I can stand off and try to view this rich subjective experi­
ence with objectivity, applying all the elegant methods of science to 
determine whether I have been deceiving myself. The conviction 
grows in me that we shall discover laws of personality and behavior 
which are as significant for human progress or human understand­
ing as the law of gravity or the laws of thermodynamics.
In the last two decades I have become somewhat more accustomed 
to being fought over, but the reactions to my ideas continue to sur­

“ This is M e”
15
prise me. From my point of view I have felt that I have always put 
forth my thoughts in a tentative manner, to be accepted or rejected 
by the reader or the student. But at different times and places 
psychologists, counselors, and educators have been moved to great 
wrath, scorn and criticism by my views. As this furore has tended 
to die down in these fields it has in recent years been renewed among 
psychiatrists, some of whom sense, in my way of working, a deep 
threat to many of their most cherished and unquestioned principles. 
And perhaps the storms of criticism are more than matched by the 
damage done by uncritical and unquestioning “ disciples” — individ­
uals who have acquired something of a new point of view for them­
selves and have gone forth to do battle with all and sundry, using as 
weapons both inaccurate and accurate understandings of me and 
my work. I have found it difficult to know, at times, whether I 
have been hurt more by my “ friends” or my enemies.
Perhaps partly because of the troubling business of being struggled 
over, I have come to value highly the privilege of getting away, of 
being alone. It has seemed to me that my most fruitful periods of 
work are the times when I have been able to get completely away 
from what others think, from professional expectations and daily 
demands, and gain perspective on what I am doing. My wife and 
I have found isolated hideaways in Mexico and in the Caribbean 
where no one knows I am a psychologist; where painting, swimming, 
snorkeling, and capturing some of the scenery in color photography 
are my major activities. Yet in these spots, where no more than two 
to four hours a day goes for professional work, I have made most 
of whatever advances I have made in the last few years. I prize the 
privilege of being alone.

There, in very brief outline, are some of the externals of my pro­
fessional life. But I would like to take you inside, to tell you some

16
S p e a k in g  P e r so n a l l y
of the things I have learned from the thousands of hours I have 
spent working intimately with individuals in personal distress.
I would like to make it very plain that these are learnings which 
have significance for me. I do not know whether they would hold 
true for you. I have no desire to present them as a guide for anyone 
else. Yet I have found that when another person has been willing 
to tell me something of his inner directions this has been of value to 
me, if only in sharpening my realization that my directions are dif­
ferent. So it is in that spirit that I offer the learnings which follow. 
In each case I believe they became a part of my actions and inner 
convictions long before I realized them consciously. They are cer­
tainly scattered learnings, and incomplete. I can only say that they 
are and have been very important to me. I continually learn and 
relearn them. I frequently fail to act in terms of them, but later I 
wish that I had. Frequently I fail to see a new situation as one in 
which some of these learnings might apply.
They are not fixed. They keep changing. Some seem to be ac­
quiring a stronger emphasis, others are perhaps less important to 
me than at one time, but they are all, to me, significant.
I will introduce each learning with a phrase or sentence which 
gives something of its personal meaning. Then I will elaborate on 
it a bit. There is not much organization to what follows except that 
the first learnings have to do mostly with relationships to others. 
There follow some that fall in the realm of personal values and 
convictions.
I might start off these several statements of significant learnings 
with a negative item. In my relationships 'with persons I have found 
that it does not help, in the long run, to act as though / were some­
thing that 1 am not. It does not help to act calm and pleasant when 
actually I am angry and critical. It docs not help to act as though 
I know the answers when I do not. It does not help to act as though 
I were a loving person if actually, at the moment, I am hostile. 
It does not help for me to act as though I were full of assurance, if 
actually I am frightened and unsure. Even on a very simple level I 
have found that this statement seems to hold. It does not help for 
me to act as though I were well when I feel ill.

“ This is Ale”
17
What I am saying here, put in another way, is that I have not 
found it to be helpful or effective in my relationships with other 
people to try to maintain a fagade; to act in one way on the surface 
when I am experiencing something quite different underneath. It 
does not, I believe, make me helpful in my attempts to build up con­
structive relationships with other individuals. I would want to make 
it clear that while I feel I have learned this to be true, I have by no 
means adequately profited from it. In fact, it seems to me that most 
of the mistakes I make in personal relationships, most of the times 
in which I fail to be of help to other individuals, can be accounted 
for in terms of the fact that I have, for some defensive reason, 
behaved in one way at a surface level, while in reality my feelings 
run in a contrary direction.
A second learning might be stated as follows — 7 find I am more 
effective when I can listen acceptantly to myself, and can be myself. 
I feel that over the years I have learned to become more adequate 
in listening to myself; so that I know, somewhat more adequately 
than I used to, what I am feeling at any given moment — to be able 
to realize I am angry, or that I do feel rejecting toward this person; 
or that I feel very full of warmth and affection for this individual; 
or that I am bored and uninterested in what is going on; or that I 
am eager to understand this individual or that I am anxious and fear­
ful in my relationship to this person. All of these diverse attitudes 
are feelings which I think I can listen to in myself. One way of put­
ting this is that I feel I have become more adequate in letting myself 
be what I am. It becomes easier for me to accept myself as a de­
cidedly imperfect person, who by no means functions at all times in 
the w’ay in which I would like to function.
This must seem to some like a very strange direction in which to 
move. It seems to me to have value because the curious paradox is 
that when I accept myself as I am, then I change. I believe that I 
have learned this from my clients as well as within my own experi­
ence — that we cannot change, we cannot move away from what 
we are, until we thoroughly accept what we are. Then change 
seems to come about almost unnoticed.
Another result which seems to grow out of being myself is that

18
S p e a k in g P e r so n a l l y
relationships then become real. Real relationships have an exciting 
way of being vital and meaningful. If I can accept the fact that I 
am annoyed at or bored by this client or this student, then I am also 
much more likely to be able to accept his feelings in response. I can 
also accept the changed experience and the changed feelings which 
are then likely to occur in me and in him. Real relationships tend to 
change rather than to remain static.
So I find it effective to let myself be what I am in my attitudes; 
to know when I have reached my limit of endurance or of tolerance, 
and to accept that as a fact; to know when I desire to mold or 
manipulate people, and to accept that as a fact in myself. I would 
like to be as acceptant of these feelings as of feelings of warmth, 
interest, permissiveness, kindness, understanding, which are also a 
very real part of me. It is when I do accept all these attitudes as a 
fact, as a part of me, that my relationship with the other person 
then becomes what it is, and is able to grow and change most 
readily.
I come now to a central learning which has had a great deal of 
significance for me. I can state this learning as follows: / have found 
it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand an­
other person. The way in which I have worded this statement may 
seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand 
another? I think that it is. Our first reaction to most of the state­
ments which we hear from other people is an immediate evaluation, 
or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When someone 
expresses some feeling or attitude or belief, our tendency is, almost 
immediately, to feel “That’s right” ; or “That’s stupid” ; “That’s ab­
normal” ; “That’s unreasonable” ; “That’s incorrect” ; “That’s not 
nice.” Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely 
what the meaning of his statement is to him. I believe this is because 
understanding is risky. If I let myself really understand another 
person, I might be changed by that understanding. And we all fear 
change. So as I say, it is not an easy thing to permit oneself to under­
stand an individual, to enter thoroughly and completely and em- 
pathically into his frame of reference. It is also a rare thing.
T o understand is enriching in a double way. I find when I am

“ This is M an
19
working with clients in distress, that to understand the bizarre world 
of a psychotic individual, or to understand and sense the attitudes 
of a person who feels that life is too tragic to bear, or to understand 
a man who feels that he is a worthless and inferior individual — 
each of these understandings somehow enriches me. I learn from 
these experiences in ways that change me, that make me a different 
and, I think, a more responsive person. Even more important per­
haps, is the fact that my understanding of these individuals permits 
them to change. It permits them to accept their own fears and 
bizarre thoughts and tragic feelings and discouragements, as well as 
their moments of courage and kindness and love and sensitivity. And 
it is their experience as well as mine that when someone fully under­
stands those feelings, this enables them to accept those feelings in 
themselves. Then they find both the feelings and themselves chang­
ing. Whether it is understanding a woman who feels that very lit­
erally she has a hook in her head by which others lead her about, or 
understanding a man who feels that no one is as lonely, no one is as 
separated from others as he, I find these understandings to be of value 
to me. But also, and even more importantly, to be understood has 
a very positive value to these individuals.
Here is another learning which has had importance for me. I 
have found it enriching to open channels whereby others can com- 
municate their feelings, their private perceptual worlds, to me. Be­
cause understanding is rewarding, 1
 would like to reduce the bar­
riers between others and me, so that they can, if they wish, reveal 
themselves more fully.
In the therapeutic relationship there are a number of ways by 
which I can make it easier for the client to communicate himself. 
I can by m y own attitudes create a safety in the relationship which 
makes such communication more possible. A sensitiveness of under­
standing which sees him as he is to himself, and accepts him as hav­
ing those perceptions and feelings, helps too.
But as a teacher also I have found that I am enriched when I can 
open channels through which others can share themselves with me. 
So I try, often not too successfully, to create a climate in the class­
room where feelings can be expressed, where people can differ —

20
S p e a k in g  P e r so n a lly
with each other and with the instructor. I have also frequently 
asked for “reaction sheets” from students — in which they can ex­
press themselves individually and personally regarding the course. 
They can tell of the way it is or is not meeting their needs, they 
can express their feelings regarding the instructor, or can tell of the 
personal difficulties they are having in relation to the course. These 
reaction sheets have no relation whatsoever to their grade. Some­
times the same sessions of a course are experienced in diametrically 
opposite ways. One student says, “M y feeling is one of indefinable 
revulsion with the tone of this class.” Another, a foreign student, 
speaking of the same week of the same course says, “ Our class fol­
lows the best, fruitful and scientific way of learning. But for people 
who have been taught for a long, long time, as we have, by the lec­
ture type, authoritative method, this new procedure is ununder- 
standable. People like us are conditioned to hear the instructor, to 
keep passively our notes and memorize his reading assignments for 
the exams. There is no need to say that it takes long time for people 
to get rid of their habits regardless of whether or not their habits 
are sterile, infertile and barren.” T o open myself to these sharply 
different feelings has been a deeply rewarding thing.
I have found the same thing true in groups where I am the ad­
ministrator, or perceived as the leader. I wish to reduce the need for 
fear or defensiveness, so that people can communicate their feelings 
freely. This has been most exciting, and has led me to a whole new 
view of what administration can be. But I cannot expand on that 
here.
There is another very important learning which has come to me 
in my counseling work. I can voice this learning very briefly. I have 
fowid it highly rewarding when I can accept another person.
I have found that truly to accept another person and his feelings 
is by no means an easy thing, any more than is understanding. Can 
1
 really permit another person to feel hostile toward me? Can I 
acccpt his anger as a real and legitimate part of himself? Can I 
accept him when he views life and its problems in a way quite dif­
ferent from mine? Can I accept him when he feels very positively

“ 77. is is M e"
21
toward me, admiring me and wanting to model himself after me? 
All this is involved in acceptance, and it docs not come easy. I be­
lieve that it is an increasingly common pattern in our culture for 
each one of us to believe, “ Every other person must feel and think 
and believe the same as I do." We find it very hard to permit our 
children or our parents or our spouses to feel differently than we do 
about particular issues or problems. We cannot permit our clients 
or our students to differ from us or to utilize their experience in their 
own individual ways. On a national scale, we cannot permit another 
nation to think or feel differently than we do. Vet it has come to 
seem to me that this separateness of individuals, the right of each 
individual to utilize his experience in his own way and to discover 
his own meanings in it, — this is one of the most priceless poten­
tialities of life. Each person is an island unto himself, in a very real 
sense; and he can only build bridges to other islands if he is first 
of all willing to be himself and permitted to be himself. So I find 
that when I can accept another person, which means specifically 
accepting the feelings and attitudes and beliefs that he has as a real 
and vital part of him, then I am assisting him to become a person: 
and there seems to me great value in this.
The next learning I want to state may be difficult to communicate. 
It is this. The more I am open to the realities in vie and in the other 
person, the less do I find myself 'wishing to rush in to “fix things 
As I try to listen to myself and the experiencing going on in me, and 
the more I try to extend that same listening attitude to another 
person, the more respect I feel for the complex processes of life. 
So I become less and less inclined to hurry in to fix things, to set 
goals, to mold people, to manipulate and push them in the way that 
I would like them to go. I am much more content simply to be my­
self and to let another person be himself. I know very well that this 
must seem like a strange, almost an Oriental point of view. What is 
life for if we are not going to do things to people? W hat is life for 
if we are not going to mold them to our purposes? W hat is life for 
if we are not going to teach them the things that ire think they 
6hould learn? What is life for if we arc not going to make them

22
S p e a k in g  P e r so n a lly
think and feel as we do? H ow  can anyone hold such an inactive 
point of view as the one I am expressing? I am sure that attitudes 
such as these must be a part of the reaction of many of you.
Yet the paradoxical aspect of my experience is that the more I 
am simply willing to be myself, in all this complexity of life and the 
more I am willing to understand and accept the realities in myself 
and in the other person, the more change seems to be stirred up. It 
is a very paradoxical tiling — that to the degree that each one of us 
is willing to be himself, then he finds not only himself changing; but 
he finds that other people to whom he relates are also changing. At 
least this is a very vivid part of my experience, and one of the deepest 
tilings I think I have learned in my personal and professional life.
Let me turn now to some other learnings which are less concerned 
with relationships, and have more to do with my own actions and 
values. The first of these is very brief. I can trust my experience.
One of the basic things which I was a long time in realizing, and 
which I am still learning, is that when an activity feels as though 
it is valuable or worth doing, it is worth doing. Put another way, 
I have learned that my total organismic sensing of a situation is 
more trustworthy than my intellect.
All of my professional life I have been going in directions which 
others thought wr
ere foolish, and about which I have had many 
doubts myself. But I have never regretted moving in directions 
which “ felt right,” even though I have often felt lonely or foolish 
at the time.
I have found that when I have trusted some inner non-intellectual 
sensing, I have discovered wisdom in the move. In fact I have found 
that when I have followed one of these unconventional paths be­
cause it felt right or true, then in five or ten years many of my col­
leagues have joined me, and I no longer need to feel alone in it.
As I gradually come to trust my total reactions more deeply, I 
find that I can use them to guide my thinking. I have come to have 
more respect for those vague thoughts which occur in me from 
time to time, which feel as though they were significant. I am in­
clined to think that these unclear thoughts or hunches will lead me 
to important areas. I think of it as trusting the totality of my experi­

“ This is Me”
23
ence, which I have learned to suspect is wiser than my intellect. It 
is fallible I am sure, but I believe it to be less fallible than m y con­
scious mind alone. M y attitude is very well expressed by Max Weber, 
the artist, when he says. “ In carrying on my own humble creative 
effort, I depend greatly upon that which I do not yet know, and 
upon that which I have not yet done.”
Very closely related to this learning is a corollary that, evaluation 
by others is not a guide for me. The judgments of others, while they 
are to be listened to, and taken into account for what they are, can 
never be a guide for me. This has been a hard thing to learn. I re­
member how shaken I was, in the early days, when a scholarly 
thoughtful man who seemed to me a much more competent and 
knowledgeable psychologist than I, told me what a mistake I was 
making by getting interested in psychotherapy. It could never lead 
anywhere, and as a psychologist I would not even have the oppor­
tunity to practice it.
In later years it has sometimes jolted me a bit to learn that I am, in 
the eyes of some others, a fraud, a person practicing medicine with­
out a license, the author of a very superficial and damaging sort of 
therapy, a power seeker, a mystic, etc. And I have been equally 
disturbed by equally extreme praise. But I have not been too much 
concerned because I have come to feel that only one person (at 
least in my lifetime, and perhaps ever) can know whether what I 
am doing is honest, thorough, open, and sound, or false and de­
fensive and unsound, and I am that person. I am happy to get all 
sorts of evidence regarding what I am doing and criticism (both 
friendly and hostile) and praise (both sincere and fawning) are a 
part of such evidence. But to weigh this evidence and to determine 
its meaning and usefulness is a task I cannot relinquish to anyone 
else.
In view of what I have been saying the next learning will prob­
ably not surprise you. Experience is, for me, the highest authority. 
The touchstone of validity is my own experience. N o other person’s 
ideas, and none of my own ideas, are as authoritative as my experi­
ence. It is to experience that I must return again and again, to dis­

24
S p e a k in g  P e r so n a l l y
cover a closer approximation to truth as it is in the process of 
becoming in me.
Neither the Bible nor the prophets — neither Freud nor research
— neither the revelations of God nor man — can take precedence 
over my own direct experience.
M y experience is the more authoritative as it becomes more pri­
mary, to use the semanticist’s term. Thus the hierarchy of experience 
would be most authoritative at its lowest level. If I read a theory of 
psychotherapy, and if I formulate a theory of psychotherapy based 
on my work with clients, and if I also have a direct experience of 
psychotherapy with a client, then the degree of authority increases 
in the order in which I have listed these experiences.
M y experience is not authoritative because it is infallible. It is the 
basis of authority because it can always be checked in new primary 
ways. In this way its frequent error or fallibility is always open to 
correction.
N ow  another personal learning. / enjoy the discovering of order 
in experience. It seems inevitable that I seek for the meaning or the 
orderliness or lawfulness in any large body of experience. It is this 
kind of curiosity, which I find it very satisfying to pursue, which has 
led me to each of the major formulations I have made. It led me to 
search for the orderliness in all the conglomeration of things cli­
nicians did for children, and out of that came my book on The Clini­
cal Treatment of the Problem Child. It led me to formulate the 
general principles which seemed to be operative in psychotherapy, 
and that has led to several books and many articles. It has led me 
into research to test the various types of lawfulness which I feel I 
have encountered in my experience. It has enticed me to construct 
theories to bring together the orderliness of that which has already 
been experienced and to project this order forward into new and 
unexplored realms where it may be further tested.
Thus I have come to see both scientific research and the process 
of theory construction as being aimed toward the inward ordering of 
significant experience. Research is the persistent disciplined effort 
to make sense and order out of the phenomena of subjective experi­

“ This is M e”
25
ence. It is justified because it is satisfying to perceive the world as 
having order, and because rewarding results often ensue when one 
understands the orderly relationships which appear in nature.
So I have come to recognize that the reason I devote myself to 
research, and to the building of theory, is to satisfy a need for per­
ceiving order and meaning, a subjective need which exists in me. 
I have, at times, carried on research for other reasons — to satisfy 
others, to convince opponents and sceptics, to get ahead profession­
ally, to gain prestige, and for other unsavory reasons. These errors 
in judgment and activity have only served to convince me more 
deeply that there is only one sound reason for pursuing scientific 
activities, and that is to satisfy a need for meaning which is in me.
Another learning which cost me much to recognize, can be stated 
in four words. The facts are friendly.
It has interested me a great deal that most psychotherapists, es­
pecially the psychoanalysts, have steadily refused to make any sci­
entific investigation of their therapy, or to permit others to do this. 
I can understand this reaction because I have felt it. Especially in our 
early investigations I can well remember the anxiety of waiting to 
see how the findings came out. Suppose our hypotheses were dis­
proved! 
Suppose we were mistaken in our views! 
Suppose our 
opinions were not justified! A t such times, as I look back, it seems 
to me that I regarded the facts as potential enemies, as possible 
bearers of disaster. I have perhaps been slow in coming to realize 
that die facts are always friendly. Every bit of evidence one can 
acquire, in any area, leads one that much closer to what is true. And 
being closer to the truth can never be a harmful or dangerous or 
unsatisfying thing. So while I still hate to readjust my thinking, still 
hate to give up old ways of perceiving and conceptualizing, yet at 
some deeper level I have, to a considerable degree, come to realize 
that these painful reorganizations are what is known as learning, and 
that though painful they always lead to a more satisfying because 
somewhat more accurate way of seeing life. Thus at the present 
time one of die most enticing areas for thought and speculation is an 
area where several of my pet ideas have not been upheld by the

26
S p e a k in g  P e r so n a l l y
evidence. I feel if I can only puzzle my way through this problem 
that I will find a much more satisfying approximation to the truth. I 
feel sure the facts will be my friends.
Somewhere here I want to bring in a learning which has been 
most rewarding, because it makes me feel so deeply akin to others. 
I can word it this way. What is most personal is most general. There 
have been times when in talking with students or staff, or in my 
writing, I have expressed myself in ways so personal that 1
 have felt 
I was expressing an attitude which it was probable no one else could 
understand, because it was so uniquely my own. Tw o written ex­
amples of this are the Preface to Client-Centered Therapy (regarded 
as most unsuitable by the publishers), and an article on “Persons or 
Science.” In these instances I have almost invariably found that the 
very feeling which has seemed to me most private, most personal, 
and hence most incomprehensible by others, has turned out to be an 
expression for which there is a resonance in many other people. It 
has led me to believe that what is most personal and unique in each 
one of us is probably the very element which would, if it were 
shared or expressed, speak most deeply to others. This has helped 
me to understand artists and poets as people who have dared to ex­
press the unique in themselves.
There is one deep learning which is perhaps basic to all of the 
things I have said thus far. It has been forced upon me by more 
than twenty-five years of trying to be helpful to individuals in per­
sonal distress. It is simply this. It has been my experience that per­
sons have a basically positive direction. In my deepest contacts with 
individuals in therapy, even those whose troubles arc most disturb­
ing, whose behavior has been most anti-social, whose feelings seem 
most abnormal, I find this to be true. W hen I can sensitively under­
stand the feelings which they are expressing, when I am able to 
accept them as separate persons in their own right, then I find that 
they tend to move in certain directions. And what are these direc­
tions in which they tend to move? The words which I believe are 
most truly descriptive are words such as positive, constructive, 
moving toward self-actualization, growing toward maturity, grow­

“ This is Me”
27
ing toward socialization. I have come to feel that the more fully 
the individual is understood and accepted, the more he tends to 
drop the false fronts with which he has been meeting life, and the 
more he tends to move in a direction which is forward.
I would not want to be misunderstood on this. I do not have a 
Pollyanna view of human nature. I am quite aware that out of de­
fensiveness and inner fear individuals can and do behave in ways 
which are incredibly cruel, horribly destructive, immature, regres­
sive, anti-social, hurtful. Yet one of the most refreshing and invigor­
ating parts of my experience is to work w’ith such individuals and to 
discover the strongly positive directional tendencies which exist in 
them, as in all of us, at the deepest levels.
Let me bring this long list to a close with one final learning which 
can be stated very briefly. Life, at its best, is a flowing, changing 
process in which nothing is fixed. In my clients and in myself I find 
that when life is richest and most rewarding it is a flowing process. 
T o experience this is both fascinating and a little frightening. I find 
I am at my best when I can let the flow of my experience carry me, 
in a direction wiiich appears to be forward, toward goals of which 
I am but dimly aware. In thus floating with the complex stream of 
my experiencing, and in trying to understand its ever-changing com­
plexity, it should be evident that there are no fixed points. When I 
am thus able to be in process, it is clear that there can be no closed 
system of beliefs, no unchanging set of principles which I hold. Life 
is guided by a changing understanding of and interpretation of my 
experience. It is always in process of becoming.
I trust it is clear now why there is no philosophy or belief or set 
of principles which I could encourage or persuade others to have or 
hold. I can only try to live by my interpretation of the currcm 
meaning of my experience, and try to give others the permission and 
freedom to develop their own inward freedom and thus their own 
meaningful interpretation of their own experience.
If there is such a thing as truth, this free individual process of 
search should, I believe, converge toward it. And in a limited way, 
this is also what I seem to have experienced.

Some Hypotheses Regarding 
the Facilitation of 
Personal Growth

T
he three chapters which constitute Part II span a period of six 
years, from 1954 to 1960. Curiously, they span a large segment 
of the country in their points of delivery — Oberlin, Ohio; St. Louis, 
Missouri; and Pasadena, California. They also cover a period in 
which much research was accumulating,, so that statements made 
tentatively in the first paper are rather solidly confirmed by the time 
of the third.
In the following talk given at Oberlin College in 1954 I was trying 
to compress into the briefest possible time the fundamental prin­
ciples of psychotherapy which had been expressed at greater length 
in my books, (Counseling and Psychotherapy) (1942) and (Client- 
Centered Therapy) (1951). It is of interest to me that I present the 
facilitating relationship, and the outcomes, with no description of, 
or even comment on, the process by which change comes about.

T
o be fa c e d  by a troubled, conflicted person who is seeking and 
expecting help, has always constituted a great challenge to me. 
Do I have the knowledge, the resources, the psychological strength, 
31

32
H o w  C an I B e of H e l p?
the skill — do I have whatever it takes to be of help to such an indi­
vidual?
For more than twenty-five years I have been trying to meet this 
kind of challenge. It has caused me to draw upon every element of 
my professional background: the rigorous methods of personality 
measurement which I first learned at Teachers’ College, Columbia; 
the Freudian psychoanalytic insights and methods of the Institute 
for Child Guidance where I worked as interne; the continuing de­
velopments in the field of clinical psychology, with which I have 
been closely associated; the briefer exposure to the work of Otto 
Rank, to the methods of psychiatric social work, and other resources 
too numerous to mention. But most of all it has meant a continual 
learning from my own experience and that of my colleagues at the 
Counseling Center as we have endeavored to discover for ourselves 
effective means of working with people in distress. Gradually I have 
developed a way of working which grows out of that experience, 
and which can be tested, refined, and reshaped by further experience 
and by research.
A G e n e r a l H y p o t h e sis
One brief way of describing the change which has taken place in 
me is to say that in my early professional years I was asking the 
question, How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now  I 
would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relation­
ship which this person may use for his own personal growth?
It is as I have come to put the question in this second way that I 
realize that whatever I have learned is applicable to all of my human 
relationships, not just to working with clients with problems. It is 
for this reason that I feel it is possible that the learnings which have 
had meaning for me in my experience may have some meaning for 
you in your experience, since all of us are involved in human rela­
tionships.
Perhaps I should start with a negative learning. It has gradually 
been driven home to me that I cannot be of help to this troubled 
person by means of any intellectual or training procedure. N o ap­
proach which relies upon knowledge, upon training, upon the ac­
ceptance of something that is taught, is of any use. These approaches

The Facilitation of Personal Growth
33
seem so tempting and direct that I have, in the past, tried a great 
many of them. It is possible to explain a person to himself, to pre­
scribe steps which should lead him forward, to train him in knowl­
edge about a more satisfying inode of life. But such methods are, in 
mv experience, futile and inconsequential. The most they can ac­
complish is some temporary change, which soon disappears, leaving 
the individual more than ever convinced of his inadequacy.
The failure of any such approach through the intellect has forced 
me to recognize that change appears to come about through experi­
ence in a relationship. So I am going to try to state very briefly and 
informally, some of the essential hypotheses regarding a helping 
relationship which have seemed to gain increasing confirmation both 
from experience and research.
I can state the overall hypothesis in one sentence, as follows. If 
I can provide a certain type of relationship, the other person will 
discover within himself the capacity to use that relationship for 
grow th, and change and personal development will occur.
T h e R el a t io n sh ip
But what meaning do these terms have? Let me take separately 
the three major phrases in this sentence and indicate something of the 
meaning they have for me. W hat is this certain type of relationship 
I would like to provide?
I have found that the more that I can be genuine in the relation­
ship, the more helpful it will be. This means that I need to be aware 
of my own feelings, in so far as possible, rather than presenting an 
ounvard fa9ade of one attitude, while actually holding another atti­
tude at a deeper or unconscious level. Being genuine also involves 
the willingness to be and to express, in my words and my behavior, 
the various feelings and attitudes which exist in me. It is only in this 
wav that the relationship can have reality, and reality seems deeply 
important as a first condition. It is only by providing the genuine 
reality w hich is in me, that the other person can successfully seek for 
the reality in him. I have found this to be true even when the 
attitudes I feel are not attitudes with which I am pleased, or atti­
tudes which seem conducive to a good relationship. It seems ex­
tremely important to be real.

34
H o w  C an I B e of H elp?
As a second condition, I find that the more acceptance and liking 
I feel toward this individual, the more I will be creating a relation­
ship which he can use. By acceptance I mean a warm regard for him 
as a person of unconditional self-worth — of value no matter what 
his condition, his behavior, or his feelings. It means a respect and 
liking for him as a separate person, a willingness for him to possess 
his own feelings in his own way. It means an acceptance of and re­
gard for his attitudes of the moment, no matter how negative or 
positive, no matter how much they may contradict other attitudes 
he has held in the past. This acceptance of each fluctuating aspect 
of this other person makes it for him a relationship of warmth and 
safety, and the safety of being liked and prized as a person seems a 
highly important element in a helping relationship.
I also find that the relationship is significant to the extent that 
I feel a continuing desire to understand — a sensitive empathy with 
each of the client’s feelings and communications as they seem to him 
at that moment. Acceptance does not mean much until it involves 
understanding. It is only as I zmderstmd the feelings and thoughts 
which seem so horrible to you, or so weak, or so sentimental, or so 
bizarre — it is only as I see them as you see them, and accept them 
and you, that you feel really free to explore all the hidden nooks and 
frightening crannies of your inner and often buried experience. 
This freedom is an important condition of the relationship. There 
is implied here a freedom to explore oneself at both conscious and 
unconscious levels, as rapidly as one can dare to embark on this 
dangerous quest. There is also a complete freedom from any type 
of moral or diagnostic evaluation, since all such evaluations are, I 
believe, always threatening.
Thus the relationship which I have found helpful is characterized 
by a sort of transparency on my part, in which my real feelings are 
evident; by an acceptance of this other person as a separate person 
with value in his own right; and by a deep empathic understanding 
which enables me to see his private world through his eyes. When 
these conditions are achieved, I become a companion to my client, 
accompanying him in the frightening search for himself, which he 
now feels free to undertake.
I am by no means always able to achieve this kind of relationship

The Facilitation of Personal Growth
35
with another, and sometimes, even when I feel I have achieved it in 
myself, he may be too frightened to perccivc what is being offered 
to him. But I would say that when I hold in myself the kind of at­
titudes I have described, and when the other person can to some 
degree experience these attitudes, then I believe that change and con­
structive personal development will invariably occur — and I in­
clude the word “ invariably” only after long and careful considera­
tion.
T h e M o tiva tio n fo r C h a n g e
So  much for the relationship. The second phrase in my overall 
hypothesis was that the individual will discover within himself the 
capacity to use this relationship for growth. I will try to indicate 
something of the meaning which that phrase has for me. Gradually 
my experience has forced me to conclude that the individual has 
within himself the capacity and the tendency, latent if not evident, 
to move forward toward maturity. In a suitable psychological cli­
mate this tendency is released, and becomes actual rather than poten­
tial. It is evident in the capacity of the individual to understand those 
aspects of his life and of himself which are causing him pain and 
dissatisfaction, an understanding which probes beneath his con­
scious knowledge of himself into those experiences which he has 
hidden from himself because of their threatening nature. It shows 
itself in the tendency to reorganize his personality and his relation­
ship to life in ways which are regarded as more mature. Whether 
one calls it a growth tendency, a drive toward self-actualization, or 
a forward-moving directional tendency, it is the mainspring of life, 
and is, in the last analysis, the tendency upon which all psycho­
therapy depends. It is the urge whiclTls~evidcnt in all organic and 
human life — to expand, extend, become autonomous, develop, ma­
ture —  the tendency to express and activate all the capacities of the 
organism, to the extent that such activation enhances the organism 
or the self. This tendency may become deeply buried under layer 
after layer of encrusted psychological defenses; it may be hidden 
behind elaborate fagades which deny its existence; but it is my be­
lief that it exists in every individual, and awaits only the proper con­
ditions to be released and expressed.

 have attempted to describe the relationship which is basic to 
constructive personality change. 1
 have tried to put into words the 
type of capacity which the individual brings to such a relationship. 
The third phrase of my general statement was that change and per­
sonal development would occur. It is my hypothesis that in such a 
relationship the individual will reorganize himself at both the con­
scious and deeper levels of his personality in such a manner as to 
cope with life more constructively, more intelligently, and in a 
more socialized as well as a more satisfying way.
Here I can depart from speculation and bring in the steadily in­
creasing body of solid research knowledge which is accumulating. 
We know now that individuals who live in such a relationship even 
for a relatively limited number of hours show profound and signifi­
cant changes in personality, attitudes, and behavior, changes that do 
not occur in matched control groups. In such a relationship the in­
dividual becomes more integrated, more effective. He shows fewer 
of the characteristics which are usually termed neurotic or psychotic, 
and more of the characteristics of the healthy, well-functioning 
person. He changes his perception of himself, becoming more re­
alistic in his views of self. He becomes more like the person he 
wishes to be. He values himself more highly. He is more self-con­
fident and self-directing. He has a better understanding of himself, 
bccomes more open to his experience, denies or represses less of his 
experience. He becomes more accepting in his attitudes toward 
others, seeing others as more similar to himself.
In his behavior he shows similar changes. He is less frustrated by 
stress, and recovers from stress more quickly. He becomes more ma­
ture in his everyday behavior as this is observed by friends. He is 
less defensive, more adaptive, more able to meet situations creatively.
These are some of the changes which we now know come about in 
individuals who have completed a series of counseling interviews in 
which the psychological atmosphere approximates the relationship I 
described. Each of the statements made is based upon objective evi­
dence. Much more research needs to be done, but there can no 
longer be any doubt as to the effectiveness of such a relationship in 
producing personality change.

T o  me, the exciting thing about these research findings is not 
simply the fact that they give evidence of the efficacy of one form 
of psychotherapy, though that is by no means unimportant. The ex­
citement comes from the fact that these findings justify an even 
broader hypothesis regarding all human relationships. There seems 
every reason to suppose that the therapeutic relationship is only one 
instance of interpersonal relations, and that the same lawfulness 
governs all such relationships. Thus it seems reasonable to hypo­
thesize that if the parent creates with his child a psychological cli­
mate such as we have described, then the child will become more 
self-directing, socialized, and mature. T o the extent that the teacher 
creates such a relationship with his class, the student will become a 
self-initiated learner, more original, more self-disciplined, less anx­
ious and other-directed. If the administrator, or military or in­
dustrial leader, creates such a climate within his organization, then 
his staff will become more self-responsible, more creative, better 
able to adapt to new problems, more basically cooperative. It ap­
pears possible to me that we are seeing the emergence of a new field 
of human relationships, in which we may specify that if certain 
attitudinal conditions exist, then certain definable changes will oc­
cur.
C o n c l u sio n
Let me conclude by returning to a personal statement. I have 
tried to share with you something of what I have learned in trying 
to be of help to troubled, unhappy, maladjusted individuals. I have 
formulated the hypothesis which has gradually come to have mean­
ing for me — not only in my relationship to clients in distress, but 
in all my human relationships. I have indicated that such research 
knowledge as we have supports this hypothesis, but that there is 
much more investigation needed. I should like now to pull together 
into one statement the conditions of this general hypothesis, and the 
effects which are specified.
If I can create a relationship characterized on my part: 
by a genuineness and transparency, in which I am my real feel­
ings;

38
H o w  C an I B e o f  H elp?
by a warm acceptance of and prizing of the other person as a 
separate individual; 
by a sensitive ability to see his world and himself as he sees them;
Then the other individual in the relationship: 
will experience and understand aspects of himself which pre­
viously he has repressed; 
will find himself becoming better integrated, more able to func­
tion effectively; 
will become more similar to the person he would like to be; 
will be more self-directing and self-confident; 
will become more of a person, more unique and more self-ex­
pressive;
will be more understanding, more acceptant of others; 
will be able to cope with the problems of life more adequately 
and more comfortably.
I believe that this statement holds whether I am speaking of my 
relationship with a client, with a group of students or staff members, 
with my family or children. It seems to me that we have here a gen­
eral hypothesis which offers exciting possibilities for the develop­
ment of creative, adaptive, autonomous persons.

The Characteristics of 
a Helping Relationship
I
 have long had the strong conviction — some might say it was an 
obsession — that the therapeutic relationship is only a special in­
stance of interpersonal relationships in general, and that the same 
lawfulness governs all such relationships. This was the theme I chose 
to work out for myself when I was asked to give an address to the 
convention of the American Perso?mel and Guidance Association at 
St. Louis, in 1958.
Evident in this paper is the dichotomy between the objective and 
the subjective which has been such an important part of my experi­
ence during recent years. I find it very difficult to give a paper 
which is either wholly objective or wholly subjective. I like to 
bring the two worlds into close juxtaposition, even if I cannot fully 
reconcile them.

y  i n t e r e s t  in  p s y c h o th e r a p y  has brought about in me an inter­

a relationship in which at least one of the parties has the intent of 
39

40
H ow  C an I B e oi-
 H elp?
promoting the growth, development, maturity, improved function­
ing, improved coping with life of the other. The other, in this sense, 
may be one individual or a group. T o  put it in another way, a help­
ing relationship might be defined as one in which one of the par­
ticipants intends that there should come about, in one or both 
parties, more appreciation of, more expression of, more functional 
use of the latent inner resources of the individual.
Now  it is obvious that such a definition covers a wide range of 
relationships which usually are intended to facilitate growth. It 
would certainly include the relationship between mother and child, 
father and child. It would include the relationship between the 
physician and his patient. The relationship between teacher and 
pupil would often come under this definition, though some teachers 
would not have the promotion of growth as their intent. It includes 
almost all counselor-client relationships, whether we are speaking of 
educational counseling, vocational counseling, or personal counsel­
ing. In this last-mentioned area it would include the wide range of 
relationships between the psychotherapist and the hospitalized psy­
chotic, the therapist and the troubled or neurotic individual, and the 
relationship between the therapist and the increasing number of so- 
called “ normal” individuals who enter therapy to improve their 
own functioning or accelerate their personal growth.
These are largely one-to-one relationships. But we should also 
think of the large number of individual-group interactions which 
are intended as helping relationships. Some administrators intend 
that their relationship to their staff groups shall be of the sort which 
promotes growth, though other administrators would not have this 
purpose. The interaction between the group therapy leader and 
his group belongs here. So does the relationship of the community 
consultant to a community group. Increasingly the interaction be­
tween the industrial consultant and a management group is intended 
as a helping relationship. Perhaps this listing will point up the fact 
that a great many of the relationships in which we and others are 
involved fall within this category of interactions in which there is 
the purpose of promoting development and more mature and ade­
quate functioning.

41
T h e Q u e st io n
But what are the characteristics of those relationships which do 
Jielp, which do facilitate growth? And at the other end of the scale 
is it possible to discern those characteristics which make a relation­
ship unhelpful, even though it was the sincere intent to promote 
growth and development? It is to these questions, particularly the 
first, that I would like to take you with me over some of the paths 
I have explored, and to tell you where I am, as of now, in my think­
ing on these issues.
T h e  A n s w e r s  G iy^
e n  b y  R e s e a r c h
It is natural to ask first of all whether there is any empirical re­
search which would give us an objective answer to these questions. 
There has not been a large amount of research in this area as yet, but 
what there is is stimulating and suggestive. I cannot report all of it 
but I would like to make a somewhat extensive sampling of the 
studies which have been done and state very briefly some of the 
findings. In so doing, oversimplification is necessary, and I am quite 
aware that I am not doing full justice to the researches I am mention­
ing, but it may .give you the feeling that factual advances are being 
made and pique your curiosity enough to examine the studies them­
selves, if you have not already done so.
S tu d ie s o f A t t it u d e s
Most of the studies throw light on the attitudes on the part of the 
helping person which make a relationship growth-promoting or 
growth-inhibiting. Let us look at some of these.
A careful study of parent-child relationships made some years ago 
by Baldwin and others ( 1) at the Fels Institute contains interesting 
evidence. O f the various clusters of parental attitudes toward chil­
dren, the “ acceptant-democratic” seemed most growth-facilitating. 
Children of these parents with their warm and equalitarian attitudes 
showed an accelerated intellectual development (an increasing I.Q.)»

42
H o w  C a n  I B e o f  H elp?
more originality, more emotional security and control, less excit­
ability than children from other types of homes. Though somewhat 
slow initially in social development, they were, by the time they 
reached school age, popular, friendly, non-aggressive leaders.
Where parents’ attitudes are classed as “actively rejectant” the 
children show a slightly decelerated intellectual development, rela­
tively poor use of the abilities they do possess, and some lack of ori­
ginality. They are emotionally unstable, rebellious, aggressive, and 
quarrelsome. The children of parents with other attitude syndromes 
tend in various respccts to fall in between these extremes.
I am sure that these findings do not surprise us as related to child 
development. I would like to suggest that they probably apply to 
other relationships as well, and that the counselor or physician or 
administrator who is warmly emotional and expressive, respectful of 
the individuality of himself and of the other, and who exhibits a non- 
possessive caring, probably facilitates self-realization much as does 
a parent with these attitudes.
Let me turn to another careful study in a very different area. 
Whitehorn and Betz (2, 18) investigated the degree of success 
achieved by young resident physicians in working with schizo­
phrenic patients on a psychiatric ward. They chose for special study 
the seven who had been outstandingly helpful, and seven whose pa­
tients had shown the least degree of improvement. Each group had 
treated about fifty patients. The investigators examined all the avail­
able evidence to discover in what ways the A group (the successful 
group) differed from the B group. Several significant differences 
were found. The physicians in the A group tended to sec the schiz­
ophrenic in terms of the personal meaning which various behaviors 
had to the patient, rather than seeing him as a case history or a 
descriptive diagnosis. They also tended to work toward goals which 
were oriented to the personality of the patient, rather than such 
goals as reducing the symptoms or curing the disease. It was found 
that the helpful physicians, in their day by day interaction, primarily 
made use of active personal participation —  a person-to-person re­
lationship. They made less use of procedures which could be classed 
as “ passive permissive.” They were even less likely to use such pro­
cedures as interpretation, instruction or advice, or emphasis upon

Characteristics of a Helping Relationship
43
the practical care of the patient. Finally, they were much more 
likely than the B group to develop a relationship in which the patient 
felt trust and confidence in the physician.
Although the authors cautiously emphasize that these findings re­
late only to the treatment of schizophrenics, I am inclined to dis­
agree. I suspect that similar facts would be found in a research study 
of almost any class of helping relationship.
Another interesting study focuses upon the way in which the per­
son being helped perceives the relationship. Heine ( 11) studied in­
dividuals who had gone for psychotherapcutic help to psychoan­
alytic, client-centered, and Adlerian therapists. Regardless of the 
type of therapy, these clients report similar changes in themselves. 
But it is their perception of the relationship which is of particular 
interest to us here. When asked what accounted for the changes 
which had occurred, they expressed some differing explanations, de­
pending on the orientation of the therapist. But their agreement on 
the major elements they had found helpful was even more significant. 
They indicated that these attitudinal elements in the relationship 
accounted for the changes which had taken place in themselves: the 
trust they had felt in the therapist; being understood by the therapist; 
the feeling of independence they had had in making choices and de­
cisions. The therapist procedure which they had found most help­
ful was that the therapist clarified and openly stated feelings which 
the client had been approaching hazily and hesitantly.
There was also a high degree of agreement among these clients, 
regardless of the orientation of their therapists, as to what elements 
had been unhelpful in the relationship. Such therapist attitudes as 
lack of interest, remoteness or distance, and an over-degree of sym­
pathy, were perceived as unhelpful. As to procedures, they had 
found it unhelpful when therapists had given direct specific advice 
regarding decisions or had emphasized past history rather than pre­
sent problems. Guiding suggestions mildly given were perccived 
in an intermediate range — neither clcarly helpful nor unhelpful.
Fiedler, in a much quoted study ( 7), found that expert therapists 
of differing orientations formed similar relationships with their 
clients. Less well known are the elements which charactcri/cd these 
relationships, differentiating them from the relationships formed by

44
H o w  C a n  I B e  o r H e lp ?
less expert therapists. These elements are: an ability to understand 
the client’s meanings and feelings; a sensitivity to the client’s atti­
tudes; a warm interest without any emotional over-involvement.
A study by Quinn (14) throws light on what is involved in un­
derstanding the client’s meanings and feelings. His study is surprising 
in that it shows that “ understanding” of the client’s meanings is es­
sentially an attitude of desiring to understand. Quinn presented his 
judges only with recorded therapist statements taken from inter­
views. The raters had no knowledge of what the therapist was re­
sponding to or how the client reacted to his response. Yet it was 
found that the degree of understanding could be judged about as 
well from this material as from listening to the response in context. 
This seems rather conclusive evidence that it is an attitude of want­
ing to understand which is communicated.
As to the emotional quality of the relationship, Seeman (16) found 
that success in psychotherapy is closely associated with a strong and 
growing mutual liking and respect between client and therapist.
An interesting study by Dittes (4) indicates how delicate this re­
lationship is. Using a physiological measure, the psychogalvanic 
reflex, to measure the anxious or threatened or alerted reactions of 
the client, Dittes correlated the deviations on this measure with 
judges’ ratings of the degree of warm acceptance and permissiveness 
on the part of the therapist. It was found that whenever the thera­
pist’s attitudes changed even slightly in the direction of a lesser 
degree of acceptance, the number of abrupt G SR  deviations signif­
icantly increased. Evidently when the relationship is experienced as 
less acceptant the organism organizes against threat, even at the 
physiological level.
Without trying fully to integrate the findings from these various 
studies, it can at least be noted that a few things stand out. One is 
the fact that it is the attitudes and feelings of the therapist, rather 
than his theoretical orientation, which is important. His procedures 
and techniques are less important than his attitudes. It is also worth 
noting that it is the way in which his attitudes and procedures are 
perceived which makes a difference to the client, and that it is this 
perception which is crucial.

Let me turn to research of a very different sort, some of which 
you may find rather abhorrent, but which nevertheless has a bearing 
upon the nature of a facilitating relationship. These studies have to 
do with what we might think of as manufactured relationships.
Verplanck (17), Greenspoon (8) and others have shown that 
operant conditioning of verbal behavior is possible in a relationship. 
Very briefly, if the experimenter says “Mhm,” or “ Good,” or nods 
his head after certain types of words or statements, those classes of 
words tend to increase because of being reinforced. It has been 
shown that using such procedures one can bring about increases in 
such diverse verbal categories as plural nouns, hostile words, state­
ments of opinion. The person is completely unaware that he is being 
influenced in any way by these reinforcers. The implication is that 
by such selective reinforcement we could bring it about that the 
other person in the relationship would be using whatever kinds of 
words and making whatever kinds of statements we had decided to 
reinforce.
Following still further the principles of operant conditioning as 
developed by Skinner and his group, Lindsley ( 12) has shown that a 
chronic schizophrenic can be placed in a “helping relationship” with 
a machine. The machine, somewhat like a vending machine, can be 
set to reward a variety of types of behaviors. Initially it simply re­
w ards— with candy, a cigarette, or the display of a picture — the 
lever-pressing behavior of the patient. But it is possible to set it so 
that many pulls on the lever may supply a hungry kitten —  visible 
in a separate enclosure —  with a drop of milk. In this case the satis­
faction is an altruistic one. Plans are being developed to reward simi­
lar social or altruistic behavior directed toward another patient, 
placed in the next room. The only limit to the kinds of behavior 
which might be rewarded lies in the degree of mechanical ingenuity 
of the experimenter.
Lindsley reports that in some patients there has been marked clin­
ical improvement. Personally I cannot help but be impressed by the 
description of one patient who had gone from a deteriorated chronic

46
H o w  C an I B e of H elp?
state to being given free grounds privileges, this change being quite 
clearly associated with his interaction with the machine. Then the 
experimenter decided to study experimental extinction, which, put 
in more personal terms, means that no matter how many thousands 
of times the lever was pressed, no reward of any kind was forthcom­
ing. The patient gradually regressed, grew untidy, uncommunica­
tive, and his grounds privilege had to be revoked. This (to me) 
pathetic incident would seem to indicate that even in a relationship 
to a machine, trustworthiness is important if the relationship is to 
be helpful.
Still another interesting study of a manufactured relationship is 
being carried on by Harlow and his associates ( 10), this time with 
monkeys. Infant monkeys, removed from their mothers almost im­
mediately after birth, are, in one phase of the experiment, presented 
with two objects. One might be termed the “ hard mother,” a slop­
ing cylinder of wire netting with a nipple from which the baby may 
feed. The other is a “soft mother,” a similar cylinder made of foam 
rubber and terry cloth. Even when an infant gets all his food from 
the “ hard mother” he clearly and increasingly prefers the “soft 
mother.” Motion pictures show that he definitely “relates” to this 
object, playing with it, enjoying it, finding security in clinging to it 
when strange objects are near, and using that security as a home base 
for venturing into the frightening world. O f the many interesting 
and challenging implications of this study, one seems reasonably 
clear. It is that no amount of direct food reward can take the place 
of certain perceived qualities which the infant appears to need and 
desire.

Let me close this wide-ranging —  and perhaps perplexing — sam­
pling of research studies with an account of two very recent in­
vestigations. The first is an experiment conducted by Ends and Page 
(5). W orking with hardened chronic hospitalized alcoholics who 
had been committed to a state hospital for sixty days, they tried 
three different methods of group psychotherapy. The method which 
they believed would be most effective was therapy based on a two- 
factor theory of learning; a client-centered approach was expected

Characteristics of a Helping Relationship
47
to be second; a psychoanalytically oriented approach was expected 
to be least efficient. Their results showed that the therapy based 
upon a learning theory approach was not only not helpful, but was 
somewhat deleterious. The outcomes were worse than those in the 
control group which had no therapy. The analytically oriented ther­
apy produced some positive gain, and the client-centered group 
therapy was associated with the greatest amount of positive change. 
Follow-up data, extending over one and one-half years, confirmed 
the in-hospital findings, with the lasting improvement being greatest 
in the client-centered approach, next in the analytic, next the con­
trol group, and least in those handled by a learning theory approach.
As I have puzzled over this study, unusual in that the approach to 
which the authors were committed proved least effective, I find a 
clue, I believe, in the description of the therapy based 011 learning 
theory (13). Essentially it consisted (tf) of pointing out and label­
ling the behaviors which had proved unsatisfying, (b) of exploring 
objectively with the client the reasons behind these behaviors, and 
( c) of establishing through re-education more effective problem­
solving habits. But in all of this interaction the aim, as they formu­
lated it, was to be impersonal. The therapist “ permits as little of his 
own personality to intrude as is humanly possible.” The “ therapist 
stresses personal anonymity in his activities, i.e., he must studiously 
avoid impressing the patient with his own (therapist’s) individual 
personality characteristics.” T o me this seems the most likely clue 
to the failure of this approach, as I try to interpret the facts in the 
light of the other research studies. T o  withhold one’s self as a per­
son and to deal with the other person as an object docs not have a 
high probability of being helpful.
The final study I wish to report is one just being completed by 
Halkidcs (9). She started from a theoretical formulation of mine 
regarding the necessary and sufficient conditions for therapeutic 
change (15). She hypothesized that there would be a significant re­
lationship between the extent of constructive personality change in 
the client and four counselor variables: (a) the degree of empathic 
understanding of the client manifested by the counselor; (b) the 
degree of positive affective attitude (unconditional positive regard) 
manifested by the counselor toward the client; ( c ) the extent to

48
H o w  C an I B e o f  H el p?
which the counselor is genuine, his words matching his own inter­
nal feeling; and (d) the extent to which the counselor’s response 
matches the client’s expression in the intensity of affective expres­
sion.
T o investigate these hypotheses she first selected, by multiple ob­
jective criteria, a group of ten cases which could be classed as “most 
successful” and a group of ten “ least successful” cases. She then 
took an early and late recorded interview from each of these cases. 
On a random basis she picked nine client-counselor interaction units
— a client statement and a counselor response — from each of these 
interviews. She thus had nine early interactions and nine later in­
teractions from each case. This gave her several hundred units which 
were now placed in random order. The units from an early inter­
view of an unsuccessful case might be followed by the units from 
a late interview of a successful case, etc.
Three judges, who did not know the cases or their degree of 
success, or the source of any given unit, now listened to this material 
four different times. They rated each unit on a seven point scale, 
first as to the degree of empathy, second as to the counselor’s 
positive attitude toward the client, third as to the counselor’s con­
gruence or genuineness, and fourth as to the degree to which the 
counselor’s response matched the emotional intensity of the client’s 
expression.
I think all of us who knew of the study regarded it as a very bold 
venture. Could judges listening to single units of interaction possibly 
make any reliable rating of such subtle qualities as I have mentioned? 
And even if suitable reliability could be obtained, could eighteen 
counselor-client interchanges from each case —  a minute sampling 
of the hundreds or thousands of such interchanges which occurred 
in each case — possibly bear any relationship to the therapeutic 
outcome? The chance seemed slim.
The findings are surprising. It proved possible to achieve high 
reliability between the judges, most of the inter-judge correlations 
being in the 0.80’s or 0.90’s, except on the last variable. It was found 
that a high degree of empathic understanding was significantly as­
sociated, at a .001 level, with the more successful cases. A high de­
gree of unconditional positive regard was likewise associated with

Characteristics of a Helping Relationship
49
the more successful eases, at the .001 level. Even the rating of the 
counselor’s genuineness or congruence —  the extent to which his 
words matched his feelings — was associated with the successful out­
come of the case, and again at the .001 level of significance. Only 
in the investigation of the matching intensity of afTcctive expression 
were the results equivocal.
It is of interest too that high ratings of these variables were not 
associated more significantly with units from later interviews than 
with units from early interviews. This means that the counselor’s 
attitudes were quite constant throughout the interviews. If he was 
highly empathic, he tended to be so from first to last. If he was lack­
ing in genuineness, tliis tended to be true of both early and late 
interviews.
As with any study, this investigation has its limitations. It is 
concerned with a certain type of helping relationship, psycho­
therapy. It investigated only four variables thought to be significant. 
Perhaps there are many others. Nevertheless it represents a signif­
icant advance in the study of helping relationships. Let me try to 
state the findings in the simplest possible fashion. It seems to indi­
cate that the quality of the counselor’s interaction with a client can 
be satisfactorily judged on the basis of a very small sampling of his 
behavior. It also means that if the counselor is congruent or trans­
parent, so that his words are in line with his feelings rather than the 
two being discrepant; if the counselor likes the client, uncondi­
tionally; and if the counselor understands the essential feelings of 
the client as they seem to the client — then there is a strong proba­
bility that this will be an effective helping relationship.
S o m e C o m m e n t s
These then are some of the studies which throw at least a measure 
of light on the nature of the helping relationship. They have inves­
tigated different facets of the problem. They have approached it 
from very different theoretical contexts. They have used different 
methods. They are not directly comparable. Yet they seem to me 
to point to several statements which may be made with some assur­
ance. It seems clear that relationships which are helpful have dif­
ferent characteristics from relationships which are unhelpful. These

50
H o w  C a n  I B e o f  H e lp?
differential characteristics have to do primarily with the attitudes of 
the helping person on the one hand and with the perception of the 
relationship by the “hclpee” on the other. It is equally clear that the 
studies thus far made do not give us any final answers as to what 
is a helping relationship, nor how it is to be formed.
H ow  C an I C rk a te a H e l p in g  R e l a t io n sh ip?
I believe each of us working in the field of human relationships 
has a similar problem in knowing how to use such research knowl­
edge. VVe cannot slavishly follow such findings in a mechanical way 
or we destroy the personal qualities which these very studies show 
to be valuable. It seems to me that we have to use these studies, 
testing them against our own experience and forming new and 
further personal hypotheses to use and test in our own further per­
sonal relationships.
So rather than try to tell you how you should use the findings I 
have presented I should like to tell you the kind of questions which 
these studies and my own clinical experience raise for me, and some 
of the tentative and changing hypotheses which guide my behavior 
as I enter into what I hope may be helping relationships, whether 
with students, staff, family, or clients. Let me list a number of these 
questions and considerations.
1. 
Can I be in some way which will be perceived by the other 
person as trustworthy, as dependable or consistent in some deep 
sense? Both research and experience indicate that this is very im­
portant, and over the years I have found what I believe are deeper 
and better ways of answering this question. I used to feel that if I 
fulfilled all the outer conditions of trustworthiness — keeping ap­
pointments, respecting the confidential nature of the interviews, etc.
— and if I acted consistently the same during the interviews, then 
this condition would be fulfilled. But experience drove home the 
fact that to act consistently acceptant, for example, if in fact I was 
feeling annoyed or skeptical or some other non-acceptant feeling, 
was certain in the long run to be perceived as inconsistent or un­
trustworthy. I have come to recognize that being trustworthy does 
not demand that I be rigidly consistent but that I be dependably 
real. The term “ congruent” is one I have used to describe the way

Characteristics of a Helping Relationship
51
I would like to be. By this I mean that whatever feeling or attitude 
I am experiencing would be matched by my awareness of that at­
titude. When this is true, then 1
 am a unified or integrated person 
in that moment, and hence I can be whatever I deeply am. This is 
a reality which I find others experience as dependable.
2. 
A very closely related question is this: Can I be expressive 
enough as a person that what I am will be communicated unambig­
uously? I believe that most of my failures to achieve a helping re­
lationship can be traced to unsatisfactory answers to these two 
questions. When I am experiencing an attitude of annoyance to­
ward another person but am unaware of it, then my communication 
contains contradictory messages. M y words are giving one message, 
but I am also in subtle ways communicating the annoyance I feel and 
this confuses the other person and makes him distrustful, though he 
too may be unaware of what is causing the difficulty. When as a 
parent or a therapist or a teacher or an administrator I fail to listen 
to what is going on in me, fail bccause of my own defensiveness to 
sense my own feelings, then this kind of failure seems to result. It 
has made it seem to me that the most basic learning for anyone who 
hopes to establish any kind of helping relationship is that it is safe 
to be transparently real. If in a given relationship I am reasonably 
congruent, if no feelings relevant to the relationship are hidden either 
to me or the other person, then I can be almost sure that the relation­
ship will be a helpful one.
One way of putting this which may seem strange to you is that if 
I can form a helping relationship to myself — if I can be sensitively 
aware of and acceptant toward my own feelings — then the likeli­
hood is great that I can form a helping relationship toward another.
Now , acceptantly to be what I am, in this sense, and to permit this 
to show through to the other person, is the most difficult task I know 
and one I never fully achieve. But to realize that this is m y task 
has been most rewarding because it has helped me to find what has 
gone wrong with interpersonal relationships which have become 
snarled and to put them on a constructive track again. It has meant 
that if I am to facilitate the personal growth of others in relation 
to me, then I must grow, and while this is often painful it is also 
enriching.

52
H ow  C a n  I B e o f  H e lp ?
3. A third question is: Can I let myself experience positive atti­
tudes toward this other person — attitudes of warmth, caring, lik­
ing, interest, respect? It is not easy. I find in myself, and feel that 
I often see in others, a certain amount of fear of these feelings. 
We are afraid that if we let ourselves freely experience these positive 
feelings toward another we may be trapped by them. They may 
lead to demands on us or we may be disappointed in our trust, and 
these outcomes we fear. So as a reaction we tend to build up dis­
tance between ourselves and others — aloofness, a “ professional” 
attitude, an impersonal relationship.
I feel quite strongly that one of the important reasons for the pro­
fessionalization of every field is that it helps to keep this distance. 
In the clinical areas we develop elaborate diagnostic formulations, 
seeing the person as an object. In teaching and in administration 
we develop all kinds of evaluative procedures, so that again the per­
son is perceived as an object. In these ways, I believe, we can keep 
ourselves from experiencing the caring which would exist if we rec­
ognized the relationship as one between two persons. It is a real 
achievement when we can learn, even in certain relationships or at 
certain times in those relationships, that it is safe to care, that it is 
safe to relate to the other as a person for whom we have positive 
feelings.
4. Another question the importance of which I have learned in my 
own experience is: Can I be strong enough as a person to be separate 
from the other? Can I be a sturdy respecter of my own feelings, 
my own needs, as well as his? Can I own and, if need be, express 
my own feelings as something belonging to me and separate from 
his feelings? Am I strong enough in my own separateness that I will 
not be downcast by his depression, frightened by his fear, nor en­
gulfed by his dependency? Is my inner self hardy enough to realize 
that I am not destroyed by his anger, taken over by his need for 
dependence, nor enslaved by his love, but that I exist separate from 
him with feelings and rights of my own? When I can freely feel 
this strength of being a separate person, then I find that I can let 
myself go much more deeply in understanding and accepting him 
because I am not fearful of losing myself.
5. The next question is closely related. Am I secure enough

Characteristics of a Helping Relationship
53
within myself to permit him his separateness? Can I permit him to 
be what he is — honest or deceitful, infantile or adult, despairing or 
ovcr-confident? Can I give him the freedom to be? Or do I feel that 
he should follow my advice, or remain somewhat dependent on me, 
or mold himself after me? In this connection I think of the inter­
esting small study by Farson (6) which found that the less well ad­
justed and less competent counselor tends to induce conformity to 
himself, to have clients who model themselves after him. On the 
other hand, the better adjusted and more competent counselor can 
interact with a client through many interviews without interfering 
with the freedom of the client to develop a personality quite separate 
from that of his therapist. I should prefer to be in this latter class, 
whether as parent or supervisor or counselor.
6. 
Another question I ask myself is: Can I let myself enter fully 
into the world of his feelings and personal meanings and see these 
as he does? Can I step into his private world so completely that I 
lose all desire to evaluate or judge it? Can I enter it so sensitively 
that I can move about in it freely, without trampling on meanings 
which are precious to him? Can I sense it so accurately that I can 
catch not only the meanings of his experience which are obvious to 
him, but those meanings w hich are only implicit, which he secs only 
dimly or as confusion? Can I extend this understanding without 
limit? I think of the client who said, “Whenever I find someone who 
understands a part of me at the time, then it never fails that a point 
is reachcd w here I know they’re not understanding me again . . . 
What I’ve looked for so hard is for someone to understand.”
For myself I find it easier to feel this kind of understanding, and 
to communicate it, to individual clients than to students in a class 
or staff members in a group in which I am involved. There is a 
strong temptation to set students “straight,” or to point out to a 
staff member the errors in his thinking. Yet when I can permit 
myself to understand in these situations, it is mutually rewarding. 
And with clients in therapy, I am often impressed with the fact that 
even a minimal amount of empathic understanding — a bumbling 
and faulty attempt to catch the confused complexity of the client’s 
meaning— is helpful, though there is no doubt that it is most help­
ful when I can see and formulate clearly the meanings in his experi­

54
H o w  C an  I B e o f  H elp?
encing which for him have been unclear and tangled.
7. Still another issue is whether I can be acceptant of each facet 
of this other person which he presents to me. Can I receive him as 
he is? Can I communicate this attitude? Or can I only receive him 
conditionally, acceptant of some aspects of his feelings and silently 
or openly disapproving of other aspects? It has been my experience 
that when my attitude is conditional, then he cannot change or 
grow in those respects in which I cannot fully receive him. And 
when — afterward and sometimes too late — I try to discover why 
I have been unable to accept him in every respect, I usually discover 
that it is because I have been frightened or threatened in myself 
by some aspect of his feelings. If I am to be more helpful, then I must 
myself grow and accept myself in these respects.
8. A very practical issue is raised by the question: Can I act with 
sufficient sensitivity in the relationship that my behavior will not be 
perceived as a threat? The work we are beginning to do in studying 
the physiological concomitants of psychotherapy confirms the re­
search by Dittes in indicating how easily individuals are threatened 
at a physiological level. The psychogalvanic reflex —  the measure 
of skin conductance — takes a sharp dip when the therapist responds 
with some word which is just a little stronger than the client’s 
feelings. And to a phrase such as, “ My you do look upset,” the 
needle swings almost off the paper. M y desire to avoid even such 
minor threats is not due to a hypersensitivity about my client. It is 
simply due to the conviction based on experience that if I can free 
him as completely as possible from external threat, then he can begin 
to experience and to deal with the internal feelings and conflicts 
which he finds threatening within himself.
9. A specific aspect of the preceding question but an important 
one is: Can I free him from the threat of external evaluation? In 
almost every phase of our lives —  at home, at school, at work — we 
find ourselves under the rewards and punishments of external judg­
ments. “ That’s good” ; “ that’s naughty.” “That’s worth an A ” ; 
“that’s a failure.” “ That’s good counseling” ; “that’s poor counsel­
ing.” Such judgments are a part of our lives from infancy to old 
age. I believe they have a certain social usefulness to institutions and 
organizations such as schools and professions. Like everyone else

Characteristics of a Helping Relationship
55
I find myself all too often making such evaluations. But, in my ex­
perience, they do not make for personal growth and hence I do not 
believe that they are a part of a helping relationship. Curiously 
enough a positive evaluation is as threatening in the long run as a 
negative one, since to inform someone that he is good implies that 
you also have the right to tell him he is bad. So I have come to feel 
that the more I can keep a relationship free of judgment and evalua­
tion, the more this will permit the other person to reach the point 
where he recognizes that the locus of evaluation, the center of re­
sponsibility, lies within himself. The meaning and value of his ex­
perience is in the last analysis something which is up to him, and 
no amount of external judgment can alter this. So I should like to 
work toward a relationship in which I am not, even in my own feel­
ings, evaluating him. This I believe can set him free to be a self- 
responsible person.
10. 
One last question: Can I meet this other individual as a per­
son who is in process of becoming, or will I be bound by his past 
and by my past? If, in my encounter with him, I am dealing with 
him as an immature child, an ignorant student, a neurotic personal­
ity, or a psychopath, each of these concepts of mine limits what he 
can be in the relationship. Martin Buber, the existentialist philoso­
pher of the University of Jerusalem, has a phrase, “confirming the 
other,” which has had meaning for me. He says “ Confirming means 
. . . accepting the whole potentiality of the other. . . .  I can rec­
ognize in him, know in him, the person he has been . . . created to 
become. . . .  I confirm him in myself, and then in him, in relation 
to this potentiality that . . . can now be developed, can evolve” (3). 
If I accept the other person as something fixed, already diagnosed 
and classified, already shaped by his past, then I am doing my part to 
confirm this limited hypothesis. If I accept him as a process of be­
coming, then I am doing what I can to confirm or make real his 
potentialities.
It is at this point that I see Verplanck, Lindsley, and Skinner, 
working in operant conditioning, coming together with Buber, the 
philosopher or mystic. At least they come together in principle, 
in an odd way. If I see a relationship as only an opportunity to 
reinforce certain types of words or opinions in the other, then I

56
H o w  C an I B e of H elp?
tend to confirm him as an object —  a basically mechanical, manipu­
la te  object. And if I see this as his potentiality, he tends to act in 
ways which support this hypothesis. If, on the other hand, I see a 
relationship as an opportunity to “ reinforce” all that he is, the person 
that he is with all his existent potentialities, then he tends to act in 
ways which support this hypothesis. I have then — to use Buber’s 
term — confirmed him as a living person, capable of creative inner 
development. Personally I prefer this second type of hypothesis.
C o n c l u sio n
In the early portion of this paper I reviewed some of the contribu­
tions which research is making to our knowledge about relationships. 
Endeavoring to keep that knowledge in mind I then took up the 
kind of questions which arise from an inner and subjective point of 
view as I enter, as a person, into relationships. If I could, in myself, 
answer all the questions I have raised in the affirmative, then I be­
lieve that any relationships in which I was involved would be help­
ing relationships, would involve growth. But I cannot give a posi­
tive answer to most of these questions. I can only work in the 
direction of the positive answer.
This has raised in my mind the strong suspicion that the optimal 
helping relationship is the kind of relationship created by a person 
who is psychologically mature. Or to put it in another way, the 
degree to which I can create relationships which facilitate the growth 
of others as separate persons is a measure of the growth I have 
achieved in myself. In some respects this is a disturbing thought, 
but it is also a promising or challenging one. It would indicate that 
if I am interested in creating helping relationships I have a fascinat­
ing lifetime job ahead of me, stretching and developing my poten­
tialities in the direction of growth.
I am left with the uncomfortable thought that what I have been 
working out for myself in this paper may have little relationship to 
your interests and your work. If so, I regret it. But I am at least 
partially comforted by the fact that all of us who are working in 
the field of human relationships and trying to understand the basic 
orderliness of that field are engaged in the most crucial enterprise in 
today’s world. If we are thoughtfully trying to understand our tasks

as administrators, teachers, educational counselors, vocational coun­
selors, therapists, then we are working on the problem which will 
determine the future of this planet. For it is not upon the physical 
sciences that the future will depend. It is upon us who are trying to 
understand and deal with the interactions between human beings
—  
who are trying to create helping relationships. So I hope that the 
questions I ask of myself will be of some use to you in gaining un­
derstanding and perspective as you endeavor, in your way, to facili­
tate growth in your relationships.

What We Know About Psychotherapy — 
Objectively and Subjectively
I
n the spring of 1960 1 was invited to the California Institute of 
Technology as a visitor in their “ Leaders of America” program, 
sponsored by the Cal Tech YM CA, which arranges most of the cid- 
tural programs for the Institute. As one part of this four-day visit 
1 was asked to talk to a forum of faculty and staff. I was eager to 
speak of psychotherapy in a way which wotdd make sense to phys­
ical scientists, and it seemed to me a summary of the research findings 
in regard to therapy might communicate. On the other hand I 
wished to make very clear that the personal subjective relationship 
is at least an equally fundamental part of therapeutic change. So 1 
endeavored to present both sides. I have made some changes in the 
paper, but this is essentially what I presented to the audience at Cal 
T  
ech.
I was pleased that the presentation seemed well received, but 1 
have been even more pleased that since that time a number of in­
dividuals who have experienced therapy have read the manuscript 
and seem highly enthusiastic about the description (in the second 
half of the paper) of the client's inner experience of therapy. This 
gratifies me, because I am especially eager to capture the way ther­
apy feels and seems to the client.

n t h e  f ie l d  o f p sy c h o t h e r a p y  considerable progress has been 
made in the last decade in measuring the outcomes of therapy in 
the personality and behavior of the client. In the last two or three 
years additional progress has been made in identifying the basic 
conditions in the therapeutic relationship which bring about therapy, 
which facilitate personal development in the direction of psycho­
logical maturity. Another way of saying this is that we have made 
progress in determining those ingredients in a relationship which pro­
mote personal growth.
Psychotherapy does not supply the motivation for such develop­
ment or growth. This seems to be inherent in the organism, just as 
we find a similar tendency in the human animal to develop and 
mature physically, provided minimally satisfactory conditions are 
provided. But therapy does play an extremely important part in 
releasing and facilitating the tendency of the organism toward 
psychological development or maturity, when this tendency has 
been blocked.
O b j e c t i v e  K n o w l e d g e
I would like, in the first part of this talk, to summarize what we 
know of the conditions which facilitate psychological growth, and 
something of what we know of the process and characteristics of 
that psychological growth. Let me explain what I mean when I 
say that I am going to summarize what we “ know.” I mean that I 
will limit my statements to those for which we have objective 
empirical evidence. For example, I will talk about the conditions of 
psychological growth. For each statement one or more studies could

be cited in which it was found that changes occurred in the individ­
ual when these conditions were present which did not occur in 
situations where these conditions were absent, or were present to a 
much lesser degree. As one investigator states, we have made prog­
ress in identifying the primary change-producing agents which 
facilitate the alteration of personality and of behavior in the direc­
tion of personal development. It should of course be added that 
this knowledge, like all scientific knowledge, is tentative and surely 
incomplete, and is certain to be modified, contradicted in part, and 
supplemented by the painstaking work of the future. Nevertheless 
there is no reason to be apologetic for the small but hard-won knowl­
edge which we currently possess.
I would like to give this knowledge which we have gained in the 
very briefest fashion, and in everyday language.
It has been found that personal change is facilitated when the 
psychotherapist is what he w, when in the relationship with his client 
he is genuine and without “ front” or facade, openly being the feel­
ings and attitudes which at that moment are flowing in him. W e 
have coined the term “congruence” to try to describe this condition. 
By this we mean that the feelings the therapist is experiencing are 
available to him, available to his awareness, and he is able to live these 
feelings, be them, and able to communicate them if appropriate. N o 
one fully achieves this condition, yet the more the therapist is able 
to listen acceptantly to what is going on within himself, and the 
more he is able to be the complexity of his feelings, without fear, 
the higher the degree of his congruence.
T o  give a commonplace example, each of us senses this quality in 
people in a variety of ways. One of the things which offends us 
about radio and T V  commercials is that it is often perfectly evident 
from the tone of voice that the announcer is “ putting on,” playing 
a role, saying something he doesn’t feel. This is an example of in­
congruence. On the other hand each of us knows individuals whom 
we somehow trust because we sense that they are being what they 
are, that we are dealing with the person himself, not with a polite or 
professional front. It is this quality of congruence which we sense 
which research has found to be associated with successful therapy.

62
H o w  C an I B e of H elp?
The more genuine and congruent the therapist in the relationship, 
the more probability there is that change in personality in the client 
will occur.
N ow  the second condition. W hen the therapist is experiencing 
a warm, positive and acceptant attitude toward what is in the client, 
this facilitates change. It involves the therapist’s genuine willing­
ness for the client to be whatever feeling is going on in him at that 
moment, —  fear, confusion, pain, pride, anger, hatred, love, courage, 
or awe. It means that the therapist cares for the client, in a non- 
possessive way. It means that he prizes the client in a total rather 
than a conditional way. By this I mean that he does not simply 
accept the client when he is behaving in certain ways, and disap­
prove of him when he behaves in other ways. It means an outgoing 
positive feeling without reservations, without evaluations. 
The 
term we have come to use for this is unconditional positive regard. 
Again research studies show that the more this attitude is experi­
enced by the therapist, the more likelihood there is that therapy will 
be successful.
The third condition we may call empathic understanding. When 
the therapist is sensing the feelings and personal meanings which the 
client is experiencing in each moment, when he can perceive these 
from “ inside,” as they seem to the client, and when he can success­
fully communicate something of that understanding to his client, 
then this third condition is fulfilled.
I suspect each of us has discovered that this kind of understanding 
is extremely rare. W e neither receive it nor offer it with any great 
frequency. Instead we offer another type of understanding which is 
very different. “ I understand what is wrong with you” ; “ I under­
stand what makes you act that w ay” ; or “ I too have experienced 
your trouble and I reacted very differently” ; these are the types of 
understanding which we usually offer and receive, an evaluative un­
derstanding from the outside. But when someone understands how 
it feels and seems to be me, without wanting to analyze me or judge 
me, then I can blossom and grow in that climate. And research bears 
out this common observation. W hen the therapist can grasp the 
moment-to-moment experiencing which occurs in the inner world 
of the client as the client sees it and feels it, without losing the separ­

What We Know About Psychotherapy
63
ateness of his own identity in this empathic process, then change is 
likely to occur.
Studies with a variety of clients show that when these three condi­
tions occur in the therapist, and when they are to some degree per­
ceived by the client, therapeutic movement ensues, the client finds 
himself painfully but definitely learning and growing, and both he 
and his therapist regard the outcome as successful. It seems from our 
studies that it is attitudes such as these rather than the therapist’s 
technical knowledge and skill, which are primarily responsible for 
therapeutic change.
T h e  D y n a m ic s o f C h a n g e
You may well ask, “ But why does a person who is seeking help 
change for the better when he is involved, over a period of time, in 
a relationship with a therapist which contains these elements? How 
does this come about?” Let me try very briefly to answer this 
question.
The reactions of the client who experiences for a time the kind of 
therapeutic relationship which I have described are a reciprocal of 
the therapist’s attitudes. In the first place, as he finds someone else 
listening acceptantly to his feelings, he little by little becomes able 
to listen to himself. He begins to receive the communications from 
within himself — to realize that he is angry, to recognize when he 
is frightened, even to realize when he is feeling courageous. As he 
becomes more open to what is going on within him he becomes able 
to listen to feelings which he has always denied and repressed. He 
can listen to feelings which have seemed to him so terrible, or so 
disorganizing, or so abnormal, or so shameful, that he has never 
been able to recognize their existence in himself.
While he is learning to listen to himself he also becomes more ac- 
ceptant of himself. As he expresses more and more of the hidden 
and awful aspects of himself, he finds the therapist showing a con­
sistent and unconditional positive regard for him and his feelings. 
Slowly he moves toward taking the same attitude toward himself, 
accepting himself as he is, and therefore ready to move forward in 
the process of becoming.
And finally as he listens more accurately to the feelings within,

64
H o w  C an  I Be o f  H elp ?
and becomes less evaluative and more acceptant toward himself, he 
also moves toward greater congruence. He finds it possible to move 
out from behind the facades he has used, to drop his defensive be­
haviors, and more openly to be what he truly is. As these changes 
occur, as he becomes more self-aware, more self-acceptant, less 
defensive and more open, he finds that he is at last free to change 
and grow in the directions natural to the human organism.
T h e P ro cess
N ow  let me put something of this process in factual statements, 
each statement borne out by empirical research. W e know that the 
client shows movement on each of a number of continua. Starting 
from wherever he may be on each continuum I will mention, he 
moves toward the upper end.
In regard to feelings and personal meanings, he moves away from 
a state in which feelings are unrecognized, unowned, unexpressed. 
He moves toward a flow in which ever-changing feelings are ex­
perienced in the moment, knowingly and acceptingly, and may be 
accurately expressed.
The process involves a change in the manner of his experiencing. 
Initially he is remote from his experiencing. An example would be 
the intellectualizing person who talks about himself and his feelings 
in abstractions, leaving you wondering what is actually going on 
within him. From such remoteness he moves toward an immediacy 
of experiencing in which he lives openly in his experiencing, and 
knows that he can turn to it to discover its current meanings.
The process involves a loosening of the cognitive maps of experi­
ence. From construing experience in rigid ways, which are per­
ceived as external facts, the client moves toward developing chang­
ing, loosely held construings of meaning in experience, constructs 
which are modifiable by each new experience.
In general, the evidence shows that the process moves away from 
fixity, remoteness from feelings and experience, rigidity of self- 
concept, remoteness from people, impersonality of functioning. It 
moves toward fluidity, changingness, immediacy of feelings and ex­
perience, acceptance of feelings and experience, tentativeness of 
constructs, discovery of a changing self in one’s changing experience,

What We Know About Psychotherapy
65
realness and closeness of relationships, a unity and integration of 
functioning.
We are continually learning more about this process by which 
change comes about, and I am not sure that this very brief summary 
conveys much of the richness of our findings.
T h e R e s u l t s o f T h e r a p y
But let me turn to the outcomes of therapy, to the relatively last­
ing changes which occur. As in the other things I have said I will 
limit myself to statements borne out by research evidence. The 
client changes and reorganizes his concept of himself. He moves 
away from perceiving himself as unacceptable to himself, as un­
worthy of respect, as having to live by the standards of others. He 
moves toward a conception of himself as a person of worth, as a 
self-directing person, able to form his standards and values upon the 
basis of his own experience. He develops much more positive at­
titudes toward himself. One study showed that at the beginning of 
therapy current attitudes toward self were four to one negative, 
but in the final fifth of therapy self-attitudes were twice as often 
positive as negative. He becomes less defensive, and hence more 
open to his experience of himself and of others. He becomes more 
realistic and differentiated in his perceptions. He improves in his 
psychological adjustment, whether this is measured by the Rorschach 
test, the Thematic Apperception Test, the counselor’s rating, or 
other indices. His aims and ideals for himself change so that they 
are more achievable. The initial discrepancy between the self that 
he is and the self that he wants to be is greatly diminished. Tension 
of all types is reduced — physiological tension, psychological dis­
comfort, anxiety. He perceives other individuals with more realism 
and more acceptance. He describes his own behavior as being more 
mature and, what is more important, he is seen by others who know 
him well as behaving in a more mature fashion.
N ot only arc these changes shown by various studies to occur 
during the period of therapy, but carcful follow-up studies con­
ducted six to eighteen months following the conclusion of therapy 
indicate that these changes persist.
Perhaps the facts I have given will make it clear why I feel that

66
H o w  C an  I Be o f  H elp ?
we are approaching the point where we can write a genuine equa­
tion in this subtle area of interpersonal relationships. Using all of 
the research findings we have, here is a tentative formulation of the 
crude equation which I believe contains the facts.
The more that the client perceives the therapist as real or genuine, 
as empathic, as having an unconditional regard for him, the more 
the client will move away from a static, fixed, unfeeling, impersonal 
type of functioning, and the more he will move toward a way of 
functioning marked by a fluid, changing, acceptant experiencing 
of differentiated personal feelings. The conscquence of this move­
ment is an alteration in personality and behavior in the direction of 
psychic health and maturity and more realistic relationships to self, 
others, and the environment.
T h e  S u b j e c t i v e  P i c t u r e
Up to this point I have spoken of the process of counseling and 
therapy objectively, stressing what we know, writing it as a crude 
equation in which we can at least tentatively put down the specific 
terms. But let me now try to approach it from the inside, and with­
out ignoring this factual knowledge, present this equation ns it oc­
curs subjectively in both therapist and client. I want to do this 
because therapy in its occurrence is a highly personal, subjective 
experience. This experience has qualities quite different from the 
objective characteristics it possesses when viewed externally.
T h e  T h e r a p is t ’s E x p e r ie n c e
T o the therapist, it is a new venture in relating. He feels, “ Here 
is this other person, my client. I’m a little afraid of him, afraid of 
the depths in him as I am a little afraid of the depths in myself. Yet 
as he speaks, I begin to feel a respect for him, to feel my kinship to 
him. I sense how frightening his world is for him, how tightly he 
tries to hold it in place. I would like to sense his feelings, and I would 
like him to know that I understand his feelings. I would like him 
to know that I stand with him in his tight, constricted little world, 
and that I can look upon it relatively unafraid. Perhaps I can make

What We Know About Psychotherapy
67
it a safer world for him. I would like my feelings in this relationship 
with him to be as clear and transparent as possible, so that they are 
a discernible reality for him, to which he can return again and again. 
I would like to go with him on the fearful journey into himself, 
into the buried fear, and hate, and love which he has never been able 
to let flow in him. I recognize that this is a very human and un­
predictable journey for me, as well as for him, and that I may, with­
out even knowing my fear, shrink away within myself, from some 
of the feelings he discovers. T o  this extent I know I will be limited 
in my ability to help him. I realize that at times his own fears may 
make him perceive me as uncaring, as rejecting, as an intruder, as 
one who does not understand. I want fully to accept these feelings 
in him, and yet I hope also that my own real feelings will show 
through so clearly that in time he cannot fail to perccive them. 
Most of all I want him to encounter in me a real person. I do not 
need to be uneasy as to whether my own feelings are ‘therapeutic.’ 
What I am and what I feel are good enough to be a basis for therapy, 
if I can transparently be what I am and what I feel in relationship 
to him. Then perhaps he can be what he is, openly and without 
fear.”
T h e C l ie n t ’s E x p e r ie n c e
And the client, for his part, goes through far more complex se­
quences which can only be suggested. Perhaps schematically his 
feelings change in some of these ways. “I’m afraid of him. I want 
help, but I don’t know whether to trust him. He might see things 
which I don’t know in myself — frightening and bad elements. He 
seems not to be judging me, but I’m sure he is. I can’t tell him 
what really concerns me, but I can tell him about some past experi­
ences which are related to my concern. He seems to understand 
those, so I can reveal a bit more of myself.
“But now that I’ve shared with him some of this bad side of me, 
he despises me. I’m sure of it, but it’s strange I can find little evi­
dence of it. Do you suppose that what I’ve told him isn’t so bad? 
Is it possible that I need not be ashamed of it as a part of me? I no 
longer feel that he despises me. It makes me feel that I want to go 
further, exploring me, perhaps expressing more of myself. I find

68
H o w  C an I B e of H rlp?
him a sort of companion as I do this — he seems really to understand.
“But now I’m getting frightened again, and this time deeply 
frightened. I didn’t realize that exploring the unknown recesses of 
myself would make me feel feelings I’ve never experienced before. 
It’s very strange because in one way these aren’t new feelings. I 
sense that they’ve always been there. But they seem so bad and 
disturbing I’ve never dared to let them flow in me. And now as 
I live these feelings in the hours with him, I feel terribly shaky, as 
though my world is falling apart. It used to be sure and firm. Now 
it is loose, permeable and vulnerable. It isn’t pleasant to feel things 
I’ve always been frightened of before. It’s his fault. Yet curiously 
I’m eager to see him and I feel more safe when I’m with him.
“ I don’t know who I am any more, but sometimes when I feel 
things I seem solid and real for a moment. I’m troubled by the con­
tradictions I find in myself — I act one way and feel another — I 
think one thing and feel another. It is very disconcerting. It’s also 
sometimes adventurous and exhilarating to be trying to discover who 
I am. Sometimes I catch myself feeling that perhaps the person I am 
is worth being, whatever that means.
“I’m beginning to find it very satisfying, though often painful, to 
share just what it is I’m feeling at this moment. You know, it is 
really helpful to try to listen to myself, to hear what is going on in 
me. I’m not so frightened any more of what is going on in me. It 
seems pretty trust-worthy. I use some of my hours with him to dig 
deep into myself to know what I am feeling. It’s scary work, but I 
want to know. And I do trust him most of the time, and that helps. 
I feel pretty vulnerable and raw, but I know he doesn’t want to hurt 
me, and I even believe he cares. It occurs to me as I try to let myself 
down and down, deep into myself, that maybe if I could sense what 
is going on in me, and could realize its meaning, I would know who
I am, and I would also know what to do. At least I feel this knowing 
sometimes with him.
“ I can even tell him just how I’m feeling toward him at any given 
moment and instead of this killing the relationship, as I used to fear, 
it seems to deepen it. Do you suppose I could be my feelings with 
other people also? Perhaps that wouldn’t be too dangerous either.
“You know, I feel as if I’m floating along on the current of life,

What We Know About Psychotherapy
69
very adventurously, being me. I get defeated sometimes, I get hurt 
sometimes, but I’m learning that those experiences are not fatal. I 
don’t know exactly who I am, but I can feel my reactions at any given 
moment, and they seem to work out pretty well as a basis for my 
behavior from moment to moment. Maybe this is what it means to 
be me. But of course I can only do this because I feel safe in the 
relationship with my therapist. Or could I be myself this way outside 
of this relationship? I wonder. I wonder. Perhaps I could.”
W hat I have just presented doesn’t happen rapidly. It may take 
years. It may not, for reasons we do not understand very well, 
happen at all. But at least this may suggest an inside view of the 
factual picture I have tried to present of the process of psycho­
therapy as it occurs in both the therapist and his client.

Some of the Directions 
Evident in Therapy
I
n Part II,
 
although there are some brief descriptions of the process 
of change in the client, the major focus was on the relationship 
which makes these changes possible. In this and the following chap­
ter, the 77iaterial deals in a much more specific way with the nature 
of the client’s experience of change in himself.
I have a personal fondness for this chapter. It was written in 
1951-52, at a time when I was making a real effort to let myself 
sense, and then express, the phenomena which seemed central to 
therapy. My book, Client-Centered Therapy, had just been pub­
lished, but I was already dissatisfied with the chapter on the process 
of therapy, which had of course been written about two years pre­
viously. I wanted to find a more dynamic way of communicating 
what happens to the person.
So I took the case of one client whose therapy had had much 
significance for me, one which I was also studying from a research 
pohit of view, and using this as a basis, tried to express the tentative 
perceptions of the therapeutic process which were emerging in me. 
I felt very bold, and very unsure of myself, in pointing out that in 
successful therapy clients seem to come to have real affection for 
themselves. / felt even more uncertain in voicing the hypothesis that 
the core of man’s nature is essentially positive. I could not then fore-
11

T h e P ro cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
see that both of these points 'would receive increasing support from 
my experience.
T
h e  pro cess o f p sy c h o t h e r a p y , as we have come to know it from 
a client-centered orientation, is a unique and dynamic experi­
ence, different for each individual, yet exhibiting a lawfulness and 
order which is astonishing in its generality. As I have become in­
creasingly impressed by the inevitability of many aspects of this 
process, I likewise grow increasingly annoyed at the type of ques­
tions which are so commonly raised in regard to it: “Will it cure a 
compulsion neurosis?” “ Surely you don’t claim that it will erase a 
basic psychotic condition?” “ Is it suitable for dealing with marital 
problems?” “Does it apply to stutterers or homosexuals?” “Are the 
cures permanent?” These questions, and others like them, are under­
standable and legitimate just as it would be reasonable to inquire 
whether gamma rays would be an appropriate cure for chilblains. 
They are however, it seems to me, the wrong questions to ask if 
we are trying to further a deep knowledge of what psychotherapy 
is, or what it may accomplish. In this chapter I should like to ask 
what appears to me a sounder question in regard to this fascinating 
and lawful process we term therapy, and to attempt a partial answer.
Let me introduce my question in this way. Whether by chance, 
by insightful understanding, by scientific knowledge, by artistry in 
human relaionships, or by a combination of all of these elements, we 
have learned how to initiate a describable process which appears to 
have a core of sequential, orderly events, which tend to be similar 
from one client to another. W e know at least something of the atti- 
tudinal conditions for getting this process under way. W e know that 
if the therapist holds within himself attitudes of deep respect and 
full acceptance for this client as he is, and similar attitudes toward 
the client’s potentialities for dealing with himself and his situations; 
if these attitudes are suffused with a sufficient warmth, which trans-

forms them into the most profound type of liking or affection for the 
core of the person; and if a level of communication is reached so 
that the client can begin to perceive that the therapist understands 
the feelings he is experiencing and accepts him at the full depth of 
that understanding, then we may be sure that the process is already 
initiated. Then, instead of trying to insist that this process serve the 
ends we have in mind (no matter how laudable those goals may be), 
let us ask the only question by which science can genuinely be ad­
vanced. This question is: “What is the nature of this process, what 
seem to be its inherent characteristics, what direction or directions 
does it take, and what, if any, are the natural end-points of the 
process?” 
When Benjamin Franklin observed the spark coming 
from the key on his kite-string, he did not, fortunately, fall under 
the spell of its immediate and practical uses. Instead, he began to in­
quire into the basic process which made such a phenomenon pos­
sible. Though many of the answers which were put forward were 
full of specific errors, the search was fruitful, because the right ques­
tion was being asked. Thus I am making a plea that we ask the same 
question of psychotherapy, and ask it with open mind — that we 
endeavor to describe, study, and understand the basic process which 
underlies therapy, rather than attempting to warp that process to fit 
our clinical needs, or our preconceived dogma, or the evidence from 
some other field. Let us patiently examine it for what it is, in it­
self.
I have recently made an attempt to begin such a description of 
client-centered therapy (3). I will not repeat this description here, 
except to say that from the clinical and research evidence there 
seem to emerge certain persistent characteristics in the process: the 
increase in insightful statements, in maturity of reported behavior, 
in positive attitudes, as therapy progresses; the changes in perception 
of, and acceptance of, the self; the incorporation of previously denied 
experience into the self-structure; the shift in the locus of evaluation 
from outside to inside the self; the changes in the therapeutic rela­
tionship; and characteristic changes in personality structure, in be­
havior, and in physiological condition. Faulty as some of these 
descriptions may prove to be, they arc an attempt to understand the 
process of client-centered therapy in its own terms, as revealed in 
clinical experience, in electrically recorded verbatim cases, and in the

forty or more research studies which have been completed in this 
area.
My purpose in this paper is to push out beyond this material and 
to formulate certain trends in therapy which have received less 
emphasis. I should like to describe some of the directions and end 
points which appear to be inherent in the therapeutic process, which 
we have only recently begun to discern with clarity, which seem to 
represent significant learnings, and on which research is, as yet, non­
existent. In an attempt to convey meanings more adequately I shall 
use illustrative material from recorded interviews from one case. I 
shall also limit my discussion to the process of client-centered 
therapy since I have reluctantly come to concede the possibility 
thnt the process, directions, and end points of therapy may differ in 
different therapeutic orientations.
T h e E x p e r ie n c in g  o f t h e  P o t e n t ia l S e l f
One aspect of the process of therapy which is evident in all cases, 
might be termed the awareness of experience, or even “ the experi­
encing of experience.” I have here labelled it as the experiencing of 
the self, though this also falls short of being an accurate term. In the 
security of the relationship with a client-centered therapist, in the 
absence of any actual or implied threat to self, the client can let him­
self examine various aspects of his experience as they actually feel to 
him, as they are apprehended through his sensory and visceral equip­
ment, without distorting them to fit the existing conccpt of self. 
Many of these prove to be in extreme contradiction to the concept 
©f self, and could not ordinarily be experienced in their fullness, but 
in this safe relationship they can be permitted to seep through into 
awareness without distortion. Thus they often follow the schematic 
pattern, “ I am thus and so, but I experience this feeling which is very 
inconsistent with what I am” ; “I love my parents, but I experience 
some surprising bitterness toward them at times” ; “ I am really no 
good, but sometimes I seem to feel that I’m better than everyone 
else.” Thus at first the expression is that “I am a self which is dif­
ferent from a part of my experience.” Later this changes to the 
tentative pattern, “ Perhaps I am several quite different selves, or per­
haps my self contains more contradictions than I had dreamed.” Still

Directions in Therapy
77
later the pattern changes to some such pattern as this: “ I was sure 
that I could not be my experience — it was too contradictory — 
but now I am beginning to believe that I can be all of my experi­
ence.”
Perhaps something of the nature of this aspect of therapy may be 
conveyed from two excerpts from the case of Mrs. Oak. iMrs. Oak 
was a housewife in her late thirties, who was having difficulties in 
marital and family relationships when she came in for therapy. Un­
like many clicnts, she had a keen and spontaneous interest in the 
processes which she felt going on within herself, and her recorded 
interviews contain much material, from her own frame of reference, 
as to her perception of what is occurring. She thus tends to put into 
words what seems to be implicit, but unverbalized, in many clients. 
For this reason, most of the excerpts in this chapter will be taken 
from this one case.
From an early portion of the fifth interview comes material which 
describes the awareness of experience which we have been discus­
sing.
Client: It all comes pretty vague. But you know I keep, keep hav­
ing the thought occur to me that this whole process for me is kind 
of like examining pieces of a jig-saw puzzle. It seems to me I, I’m 
in the process now of examining the individual pieces which really 
don’t have too much meaning. Probably handling them, not even 
beginning to think of a pattern. That keeps coming to me. And 
it’s interesting to me because I, I really don’t like jig-saw puzzles. 
They’ve always irritated me. But that’s my feeling. And I mean 
I pick up little pieces (she gestures throughout this conversation 
to illustrate her statements) with absolutely no meaning except I 
mean the, the feeling that you get from simply handling them 
without seeing them as a pattern, but just from the touch, I prob­
ably feel, well it is going to fit someplace here.
Therapist: And that at the moment that, that’s the process, just 
getting the feel and the shape and the configuration of the differ­
ent pieces with a little bit of background feeling of, yeah they’ll 
probably fit somewhere, but most of the attention’s focused right 
on, “W hat does this feel like? And what’s its texture?”

C: That’s right. There’s almost something physical in it. A, a —
T : You can’t quite describe it without using your hands. A real, 
almost a sensuous sense in —
C: That’s right. Again it’s, it’s a feeling of being very objective, 
and yet I’ve never been quite so close to myself.
T : Almost at one and the same time standing off and looking at 
yourself and yet somehow being closer to yourself that way 
than —
C: M-hm. And yet for the first time in months I am not thinking 
about my problems. I’m not actually, I’m not working on them.
T : I get the impression you don’t sort of sit down to work on “my 
problems.” It isn’t that feeling at all.
C: That’s right. That’s right. I suppose what I, I mean actually 
is that I’m not sitting down to put this puzzle together as, as some­
thing, I’ve got to see the picture. It, it may be that, it may be that 
I am actually enjoying this feeling process. Or I’m certainly learn­
ing something.
T : At least there’s a sense of the immediate goal of getting that 
feel as being the thing, not that you’re doing this in order to see 
a picture, but that it’s a, a satisfaction of really getting acquainted 
with each piece. Is that —
C: That’s it. That’s it. And it still becomes that sort of sensuous­
ness, that touching. It’s quite interesting. Sometimes not entirely 
pleasant, I’m sure, but —
T : A rather different sort of experience.
C: Yes. Quite.
This excerpt indicates very clearly the letting of material come 
into awareness, without any attempt to own it as part of the self, 
or to relate it to other material held in consciousness. It is, to put 
it as accurately as possible, an awareness of a wide range of experi­
ences, with, at the moment, no thought of their relation to self. 
Later it may be recognized that what was being experienced may all

Directions in Therapy
79
become a part of self. Thus the heading of this section has been 
termed “The Experiencing of the Potential Self.”
The fact that this is a new and unusual form of experience is ex­
pressed in a verbally confused but emotionally clear portion of the 
sixth interview.
C: Uh, I caught myself thinking that during these sessions, uh, 
I’ve been sort of singing a song. N ow  that sounds vague and uh — 
not actually singing — sort of a song without any music. Prob­
ably a kind of poem coming out. And I like the idea, I mean it’s 
just sort of come to me without anything built out of, of anything. 
And in — following that, it came, it came this other kind of feel­
ing. Well, I found myself sort o f asking myself, is that the shape 
that cases take? Is it possible that I am just verbalizing and, at 
times kind of become intoxicated with my own verbalizations? 
And then uh, following this, came, well, am I just taking up your 
time? And then a doubt, a doubt. Then something else occurred 
to me. Uh, from whence it came, I don’t know, no actual logical 
kind of sequence to the thinking. The thought struck me: W e’re 
doing bits, uh, we’re not overwhelmed or doubtful, or show con­
cern or, or any great interest when, when blind people learn to 
read with their fingers, Braille. I don’t know — it may be just sort 
of, it’s all mixed up. It may be that’s something that I’m experienc­
ing now.
T : Let’s see if I can get some of that, that sequence of feelings. 
First, sort of as though you’re, and I gather that first one is a 
fairly positive feeling, as though maybe you’re kind of creating a 
poem here — a song without music somehow but something that 
might be quite creative, and then the, the feeling of a lot of skepti­
cism about that. “ Maybe I’m just saying words, just being carried 
off by words that I, that I speak, and maybe it’s all a lot of baloney, 
really.” And then a feeling that perhaps you’re almost learning 
a new type of experiencing which would be just as radically new 
as for a blind person to try to make sense out of what he feels with 
his fingertips.
C: M-hm. M-hm. (Pause) . . . And I sometimes think to myself, 
well, maybe we could go into this particular incident or that par-

80
T h e P r o cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
ticular incident. And then somehow when I come here, there is, 
that doesn’t 
hold true, it’s, it seems 
false. And then there 
jus
seems to be this flow of words which 
somehow aren’t forced 
an
then occasionally this doubt creeps in. Well, it sort of takes form 
of a, maybe you’re just making music. . . . Perhaps that’s why I’m 
doubtful today of, of this whole thing, because it’s something 
that’s not forced. And really I’m feeling that what I should do is, 
is sort of systematize the thing. Oughta work harder and —
T : Sort of a deep questioning as to what am I doing with a self 
that isn’t, isn’t pushing to get things done, solved? (Pause)
C: And yet the fact that I, I really like this other kind of thing, 
this, I don’t know, call it a poignant feeling, I mean — I felt things 
that I never 
felt before. I like that, too. Maybe that’s the way to
do it. I just 
don’t know today.
Here is the shift which seems almost invariably to occur in therapy 
which has any depth. It may be represented schematically as the 
client’s feeling that “ I came here to solve problems, and now I find 
myself just experiencing myself.” And as with this client this shift 
is usually accompanied by the intellectual formulation that it is 
wrong, and by an emotional appreciation of the fact that it “ feels 
good.”
W e may conclude this section saying that one of the fundamental 
directions taken by the process of therapy is the free experiencing 
of the actual sensory and visceral reactions of the organism without 
too much of an attempt to relate these experiences to the self. This 
is usually accompanied by the conviction that this material does not 
belong to, and cannot be organized into, the self. The end point of 
this process is that the client discovers that he can be his experience, 
with all of its variety and surface contradiction; that he can formu­
late himself out of his experience, instead of trying to impose a 
formulation of self upon his experience, denying to awareness those 
elements which do not fit.

One of the elements in therapy of which we have more recently 
become aware is the extent to which therapy is a learning, on the

Directions in Therapy
81
part of the client, to acccpt fully and freely and without fear the 
positive feelings of another. This is not a phenomenon which clearly 
occurs in every case. It seems particularly true of our longer cases, 
but does not occur uniformly in these. Yet it is such a deep experi­
ence that we have begun to question whether it is not a highly sig­
nificant direction in the therapeutic process, perhaps occurring at an 
unverbalized level to some degree in all successful cases. Before dis­
cussing this phenomenon, let us give it some body by citing the ex­
perience of Mrs. Oak. The experience struck her rather suddenly, 
between the twenty-ninth and thirtieth interview, and she spends 
most of the latter interview discussing it. She opens the thirtieth 
hour in his way.
C: Well, I made a very remarkable discovery. I know it’s — 
(laughs) I found out that you actually care how this thing goes. 
(Both laugh) It gave me the feeling, it’s sort of well — “maybe I’ll 
let you get in the act,” sort of thing. It’s — again you sec, on an 
examination sheet, I would have had the correct answer, I mean — 
but it suddenly dawned on me that in the — clicnt-counselor kind 
of thing, you actually care what happens to this thing. And it was 
a revelation, a — not that. 
That doesn’t describe it. 
It was 
a — well, the closest I can come to it is a kind of relaxation, a — 
not a letting down, but a — (pause) more of a straightening out 
without tension if that means anything. I don’t know.
T : Sounds as though it isn’t as though this was a new idea, but it 
was a new experience of really feeling that I did care and if I get 
the rest of that, sort of a willingness on your part to let me care.
C: Yes.
This letting the counselor and his warm interest into her life was 
undoubtedly one of the deepest features of therapy in this case. 
In 
an interview following the conclusion of therapy she spontaneously 
mentions this experience as being the outstanding one. What docs it 
mean?
The phenomenon is most ccrtainly not one of transference and 
countcrtransfcrcnce. Some experienced psychologists who had un­
dergone psychoanalysis had the opportunity of observing the de­

82
T h e P ro cess o f B e c o m in g  a P er so n
velopment of the relationship in another case than the one cited. 
They were the first to object to the use of the terms transference and 
countertransfercnce to describe the phenomena. The gist of their 
remarks was that this is something which is mutual and appropriate, 
where transference or countertransference are phenomena which are 
characteristically one-way and inappropriate to the realities of the 
situation.
Certainly one reason why this phenomena is occurring more fre­
quently in our experience is that as therapists we have become less 
afraid of our positive (or negative) feelings toward the client. As 
therapy goes on the therapist’s feeling of acceptance and respect for 
the client tends to change to something approaching awe as he sees 
the valiant and deep struggle of the person to be himself. There is, 
I think, within the therapist, a profound experience of the underlying 
commonality — should we say brotherhood — of man. As a result 
he feels toward the clicnt a warm, positive, affectional reaction. This 
poses a problem for the client who often, as in this case, finds it 
difficult to accept the positive feeling of another. Yet once accepted 
the inevitable reaction on the part of the clicnt is to relax, to let the 
warmth of liking by another person reduce the tension and fear in­
volved in facing life.
But we are getting ahead of our client. Let us examine some of 
the other aspects of this experience as it occurred to her. In earlier 
interviews she had talked of the fact that she did not love humanity, 
and that in some vague and stubborn way she felt she was right, 
even though others would regard her as wrong. She mentions this 
again as she discusses the way this experience has clarified her atti­
tudes toward others.
C: The next thing tnnt occurred to me that I found myself think­
ing and still thinking, is somehow — and I’m not clear why — the 
same kind of a caring that I get when I say “ I don’t love human­
ity.” Which has always sort of — I mean I was always convinced 
of it. So I mean, it doesn’t — I knew that it was a good thing, see. 
And I think I clarified it within myself — what it has to do with 
this situation, I don’t know. But I found out, no, I don’t love, but 
I do care terribly.

Directions in Therapy
83
T : M-hm. Al-hm. I see. . . .
C: . . . It might be expressed better in saying I care terribly what 
happens. But the caring is a — takes form — its structure is in 
understanding and not wanting to be taken in, or to contribute to 
those things which I feel are false and — It seems to me that in — 
in loving, there’s a kind of fijial factor. If you do that, you’ve sort 
of done enough. It’s a —
T: That’s it, sort of.
C: Yeah. It seems to me this other thing, this caring, which isn’t 
a good term — I mean, probably we need something else to 
describe this kind of thing. T o  say it’s an impersonal thing doesn’t 
mean anything because it isn’t impersonal. I mean I feel it’s very 
much a part of a whole. But it’s something that somehow doesn’t 
stop. . . .  It seems to me you could have this feeling of loving 
humanity, loving people, and at the same time — go on contribut­
ing to the factors that make people neurotic, make them ill — 
where, what I feel is a resistance to those things.
T : You care enough to want to understand and to want to avoid 
contributing to anything that would make for more neuroticism, 
or more of that aspect in human life.
C: Yes. And it’s — (pause). Yes, it’s something along those lines. 
. . . Well, again, I have to go back to how I feel about this other 
thing. It’s — I’m not really called upon to give of myself in a — 
sort of on the auction block. There’s nothing final. . . .  It some­
times bothered me when I —  I would have to say to myself, “ I 
don’t love humanity,” and yet, I always knew that there was some­
thing positive. That I was probably right. And — I may be all 
off the beam now, but it seems to me that, that is somehow tied 
up in the — this feeling that I — I have now, into how the thera­
peutic value can carry through. Now , I couldn’t tie it up, I 
couldn’t tie it in, but it’s as close as I can come to explaining to 
myself, my — well, shall I say the learning process, the follow 
through on my realization that — yes, you do care in a given situa­
tion. It’s just that simple. And I hadn’t been aware of it before. 
I might have closed this door and walked out, and in discussing

84
T h e P ro cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
therapy, said, yes, the counselor must feel thus and so, but, I mean, 
I hadn’t had the dynamic experience.
In this portion, though she is struggling to describe her own feel­
ing, it would seem that what she is saying would be characteristic 
of the therapist’s attitude toward the client as well. His attitude, at 
its best, is devoid of the quid pro quo aspect of most of the experi­
ences we call love. It is the simple outgoing human feeling of one 
individual for another, a feeling, it seems to me which is even more 
basic than sexual or parental feeling. It is a caring enough about the 
person that you do not wish to interfere with his development, nor 
to use him for any self-aggrandizing goals of your own. Your satis­
faction comes in having set him free to grow in his own fashion.
Our client goes on to discuss how hard it has been for her in the 
past to accept any help or positive feeling from others, and how this 
attitude is changing.
C: I have a feeling . . . that you have to do it pretty much your­
self, but that somehow you ought to be able to do that with other 
people. 
(She mentions that there have been “ countless” times 
when she might have accepted personal warmth and kindliness 
from others.) I get the feeling that I just was afraid I would be 
devastated. (She returns to talking about the counseling itself and 
her feeling toward it.) I mean there’s been this tearing through 
the thing myself. Almost to — I mean, I felt it — I mean I tried to 
verbalize it on occasion — a kind of — at times almost not want­
ing you to restate, not wanting you to reflect, the thing is mine. 
Course all right, I can say it’s resistance. But that doesn’t mean a 
damn thing to me now. . . . The — I think in — in relationship 
to this particular thing, I mean, the — probably at times, the 
strongest feeling was, it’s mine, it’s mine. I’ve got to cut it down 
myself. See?
T : It’s an experience that’s awfully hard to put down accurately 
into words, and yet I get a sense of difference here in this relation­
ship, that from the feeling that “this is mine,” “I’ve got to do it,” 
“I am doing it,” and so on, to a somewhat different feeling that — 
“ I could let you in.”

Directions in Therapy
85
C: Yeah. Now . I mean, that’s — that it’s — well, it’s sort of, shall 
we say, volume two. It’s — it’s a — well, sort of, well, I’m still in 
the thing alone, but I’m not — see —  I’m —
T: M-hm. Yes, that paradox sort of sums it up, doesn’t it?
C: Yeah.
T : In all of this, there is a feeling, it’s still — every aspect of my 
experience is mine and that’s kind of inevitable and necessary and 
so on. And yet that isn’t the whole picture either. Somehow it 
can be shared or another’s interest can come in and in some ways 
it is new.
C: Yeah. And it’s — it’s as though, that’s how it should be. I 
mean, that’s how it — has to be. There’s a — there’s a feeling, “and 
this is good.” I mean, it expresses, it clarifies it for me. There’s 
a feeling — in this caring, as though — you were sort of standing 
back — standing off, and if I want to sort of cut through to the 
thing, it’s a — a slashing of — oh, tall weeds, that I can do it, and 
you can — I mean you’re not going to be disturbed by having to 
walk through it, too. I don’t know. And it doesn’t make sense. 
I mean —
T: Except there’s a very real sense of rightness about this feeling 
that you have, hm?
C: M-hm.
May it not be that this excerpt portrays the heart of the process 
of socialization? T o  discover that it is not devastating to accept the 
positive feeling from another, that it does not necessarily end in 
hurt, that it actually “ feels good” to have another person with you in 
your struggles to meet life — this may be one of the most profound 
learnings encountered by the individual whether in therapy or not.
Something of the newness, the non-verbal level of this experience 
is described by Mrs. Oak in the closing moments of this thirtieth 
interview.
C: I’m experiencing a new type, a — probably the only worth­
while kind of learning, a — I know I’ve —  I’ve often said what I

86
T h e P ro cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
know doesn’t help me here. W hat I meant is, my acquired knowl­
edge doesn’t help me. But it seems to me that the learning process 
here has been —  so dynamic, I mean, so much a part of the — of 
everything, I mean, of me, that if I just get that out of it, it’s some­
thing, which, I mean —  I’m wondering if I’ll ever be able to 
straighten out into a sort of acquired knowledge what I have ex­
perienced here.
T : In other words, the kind of learning that has gone on here has 
been something of quite a different sort and quite a different 
depth; very vital, very real. And quite worthwhile to you in and 
of itself, but the question you’re asking is: Will I ever have a clear 
intellectual picture of what has gone on at this somehow deeper 
kind of learning level?
C: M-hm. Something like that.
Those who would apply to therapy the so-called laws of learning 
derived from the memorization of nonsense syllables would do well 
to study this excerpt with care. Learning as it takes place in therapy 
is a total, organismic, frequently non-verbal type of thing which 
may or may not follow the same principles as the intellectual learn­
ing of trivial material which has little relevance to the self. This, 
however, is a digression.
Let us conclude this section by rephrasing its essence. It appears 
possible that one of the characteristics of deep or significant therapy 
is that the client discovers that it is not devastating to admit fully 
into his own experience the positive feeling which another, the 
therapist, holds toward him. Perhaps one of the reasons why this 
is so difficult is that essentially it involves the feeling that “I am 
worthy of being liked.” This we shall consider in the following sec­
tion. For the present it may be pointed out that this aspect of 
therapy is a free and full experiencing of an affectional relationship 
which may be put in generalized terms as follows: “ I can permit 
someone to care about me, and can fully accept that caring within 
myself. This permits me to recognize that I care, and care deeply, 
for and about others.”

In various writings and researches that have been published re­
garding client-centered therapy there has been a stress upon the 
acceptance of self as one of the directions and outcomes of therapy. 
We have established the fact that in successful psychotherapy nega­
tive attitudes toward the self decrease and positive attitudes increase. 
We have measured the gradual increase in self-acceptance and have 
studied the correlated increase in acceptance of others. But as I 
examine these statements and compare them with our more recent 
cases, I feel they fall short of the truth. The client not only accepts 
himself — a phrase which may carry the connotation of a grudging 
and reluctant acceptance of the inevitable — he actually comes to 
like himself. This is not a bragging or self-assertive liking; it is 
rather a quiet pleasure in being one’s self.
Airs. Oak illustrates this trend rather nicely in her thirty-third 
interview. Is it significant that this follows by ten days the interview 
where she could for the first time admit to herself that the therapist 
cared? Whatever our speculations on this point, this fragment in­
dicates very well the quiet joy in being one’s self, together with the 
apologetic attitude which, in our culture, one feels it is necessary to 
take toward such an experience. In the last few minutes of the inter­
view, knowing her time is nearly up she says:
C: One thing worries me — and I’ll hurry because I can always 
go back to it — a feeling that occasionally I can’t turn out. Feel­
ing of being quite pleased with myself. Again the Q technique.* 
I walked out of here one time, and impulsively I threw my first 
card, “ I am an attractive personality” ; looked at it sort of aghast 
but left it there, I mean, because honestly, I mean, that is exactly 
how it felt — a — well, that bothered me and I catch that now.
• 
This portion needs explanation. As part of a research study by another 
staff member this client had been asked several times during therapy to sort a 
large group of cards, each containing a self-descriptive phrase, in such a way 
as to portray her own self. At one end of the sorting she was to place the card 
or cards most like herself, and at the other end, those most unlike herself. 
Thus when she says that she put as the first card, "I am an attractive person­
ality,” it means that she regarded this as the item most characteristic of herself.

Every once in a while a sort of pleased feeling, nothing superior, 
but just — I don’t know, sort of pleased. A neatly turned way. 
And it bothered me. And yet — I wonder — I rarely remember 
things I say here, I mean I wondered why it was that I was con­
vinced, and something about what I’ve felt about being hurt that 
I suspected in — my feelings when I would hear someone say to 
a child, “Don’t cry.” I mean, I always felt, but it isn’t right; I 
mean, if he’s hurt, let him cry. W ell, then, now this pleased feel­
ing that I have. I’ve recently come to feel, it’s — there’s some­
thing almost the same there. It’s — W e don’t object when chil­
dren feel pleased with themselves. It’s — I mean, there really isn’t 
anything vain. It’s —  maybe that’s how people shoidd feel.
T : You’ve been inclined almost to look askance at yourself for 
this feeling, and yet as you think about it more, maybe it comes 
close to the two sides of the picture, that if a child wants to cry, 
why shouldn’t he cry? And if he wants to feel pleased with him­
self, doesn’t he have a perfect right to feel pleased with himself? 
And that sort of ties in with this, what I would see as an apprecia­
tion of yourself that you’ve experienced every now and again.
C: Yes. Yes.
T : “ I’m really a pretty rich and interesting person.”
C: Something like that. And then I say to myself, “ Our society 
pushes us around and we’ve lost it.” And I keep going back to 
my feelings about children. Well, maybe they’re richer than we 
are. Maybe we — it’s something w e’ve lost in the process of grow­
ing up.
T : Could be that they have a wisdom about that that we’ve lost. 
C: That’s right. M y time’s up.
Here she arrives, as do so many other clients, at the tentative, 
slightly apologetic realization that she has come to like, enjoy, appre­
ciate herself. One gets the feeling of a spontaneous relaxed enjoy­
ment, a primitive joie de vivre, perhaps analogous to the lamb frisking 
about the meadow or the porpoise gracefully leaping in and out of 
the waves. Mrs. Oak feels that it is something native to the organism.

to the infant, something we have lost in the warping process of de­
velopment.
Earlier in this case one sees something of a forerunner of this 
feeling, an incident which perhaps makes more clear its fundamental 
nature. In the ninth interview Mrs. Oak in a somewhat embarrassed 
fashion reveals something she has always kept to herself. That she 
brought it forth at some cost is indicated by the fact that it was pre­
ceded by a very long pause, of several minutes duration. Then she 
spoke.
C: You know this is kind of goofy, but I’ve never told anyone 
this (nervous laugh) and it’ll probably do me good. For years, oh, 
probably from early youth, from seventeen probably on, I, I have 
had what I have come to call to myself, told myself were “ flashes 
of sanity.” I’ve never told anyone this, (another embarrassed 
laugh) wherein, in, really I feel sane. And, and pretty much aware 
of life. And always with a terrific kind of concern and sadness of 
how far away, how far astray that we have actually gone. It’s 
just a feeling once in a while of finding myself a whole kind of 
person in a terribly chaotic kind of world.
T : It’s been fleeting and it’s been infrequent, but there have been 
times when it seems the whole you is functioning and feeling in 
the world, a very chaotic world to be sure —
C: That’s right. And I mean, and knowing actually how far as­
tray we, we’ve gone from, from being whole healthy people. And 
of course, one doesn’t talk in those terms.
T : A feeling that it wouldn’t be safe to talk about the singing 
you* —
C: Where docs that person live?
T : Almost as if there was no place for such a person to, to exist.
C: O f course, you know, that, that makes me — now wait a min­
ute — that probably explains why I’m primarily concerned with 
feelings here. That’s probably it.

The therapist’s reference is to her statement in a previous interview that in 
therapy she was singing a song.

T : Because that whole you does exist with all your feelings. Is 
that it, you’re more aware of feelings?
C: That’s right. It’s not, it doesn’t reject feelings and — that’s it.
T : That whole you somehow lives feelings instead of somehow 
pushing them to one side.
C: That’s right. {Pause) I suppose from the practical point of 
view it could be said that what I ought to be doing is solving 
some problems, day-to-day problems. And yet, 1,1 — what I’m 
trying to do is solve, solve something else that’s a great, that is a 
great deal more important than little day-to-day problems. Maybe 
that sums up the whole thing.
T : I wonder if this will distort your meaning, that from a hard- 
headed point of view you ought to be spending time thinking 
through specific problems. But you wonder if perhaps maybe you 
aren’t on a quest for this whole you and perhaps that’s more im­
portant than a solution to the day-to-day problems.
C: I think that’s it. I think that’s it. That’s probably what I mean.
If we may legitimately put together these two experiences, and if 
we are justified in regarding them as typical, then we may say that 
both in therapy and in some fleeting experiences throughout her 
previous life, she has experienced a healthy satisfying enjoyable 
appreciation of herself as a whole and functioning creature; and that 
this experience occurs when she does not reject her feelings but 
lives them.
Here it seems to me is an important and often overlooked truth 
about the therapeutic process. It works in the direction of permit­
ting the person to experience fully, and in awareness, all of his re­
actions including his feelings and emotions. As this occurs, the in­
dividual feels a positive liking for himself, a genuine appreciation of 
himself as a total functioning unit, which is one of the important 
end points of therapy.

One of the most revolutionary concepts to grow out of our clini­

Directions in Therapy
91
cal experience is the growing recognition that the innermost core of 
man’s nature, the deepest layers of his personality, the base of his 
“animal nature,” is positive in nature —  is basically socialized, for­
ward-moving, rational and realistic.
This point of view is so foreign to our present culture that I do 
not expect it to be accepted, and it is indeed so revolutionary in its 
implications that it should not be accepted without thorough-going 
inquiry. But even if it should stand these tests, it will be difficult 
to accept. Religion, especially the Protestant Christian tradition, has 
permeated our culture with the concept that man is basically sinful, 
and only by something approaching a miracle can his sinful nature 
be negated. In psychology, Freud and his followers have presented 
convincing arguments that the id, man’s basic and unconscious na­
ture, is primarily made up of instincts which would, if permitted 
expression, result in incest, murder, and other crimes. The whole 
problem of therapy, as seen by this group, is how to hold these un­
tamed forces in check in a wholesome and constructive manner, 
rather than in the costly fashion of the neurotic. But the fact that at 
heart man is irrational, unsocialized, destructive of others and self — 
this is a concept accepted almost without question. T o  be sure there 
are occasional voices of protest. Maslow ( 1) puts up a vigorous case 
for man’s animal nature, pointing out that the anti-social emotions — 
hostility, jealousy, etc. —  result from frustration of more basic im­
pulses for love and security and belonging, which are in themselves 
desirable. And Montagu ( 2) likewise develops the thesis that co­
operation, rather than struggle, is the basic law of human life. But 
these solitary voices are little heard. On the whole the viewpoint of 
the professional worker as well as the layman is that man as he is, 
in his basic nature, had best be kept under control or under cover 
or both.
As I look back over my years of clinical experience and research, 
it seems to me that I have been very slow to recognize the falseness 
of this popular and professional concept. The reason, I believe, lies 
in the fact that in therapy there are continually being uncovered 
hostile and anti-social feelings, so that it is easy to assume that this 
indicates the deeper and therefore the basic nature of man. Only 
slowly has it become evident that these untamed and unsocial feel­

ings are neither the deepest nor the strongest, and that the inner core 
of man’s personality is the organism itself, which is essentially both 
self-preserving and social.
T o  give more specific meaning to this argument, let me turn again 
to the case of Mrs. Oak. Since the point is an important one, I shall 
quote at some length from the recorded case to illustrate the type of 
experience on which I have based the foregoing statements. Perhaps 
the excerpts can illustrate the opening up of layer after layer of 
personality until we come to the deepest elements.
It is in the eighth interview that Mrs. Oak rolls back the first 
lay*T of defense, and discovers a bitterness and desire for revenge 
underneath.
C: You know over in this area of, of sexual disturbance, I have a 
feeling that I’m beginning to discover that it’s pretty bad, pretty 
bad. I’m finding out that, that I’m bitter, really. Damn bitter. I
— and I’m not turning it back in, into myself . . .  I think what I 
probably feel is a certain element of “ I’ve been cheated.” (Her 
voice is very tight and her throat chokes up.) And I’ve covered up 
very nicely, to the point of consciously not caring. But I’m, I’m 
sort of amazed to find that in this practice of, what shall I call it, 
a kind of sublimation that right under it — again words — there’s 
a, a kind of passive force that’s, it’s pas — it’s very passive, but at 
the same time it’s just kind of murderous.
T : So there’s the feeling, “ I’ve really been cheated. I’ve covered 
that up and seem not to care and yet underneath that there’s a kind 
of a, a latent but very much present bitterness that is very, very 
strong.”
C: It’s very strong. 1
 — that I know. It’s terribly powerful.
T : Almost a dominating kind of force.
C; O f which I am rarely conscious. Almost never . . . Well, the 
only way I can describe it, it’s a kind of murderous thing, but 
without violence. . . . It’s more like a feeling of wanting to get 
even. . . . And of course, I won’t pay back, but I’d like to. I 
really would like to.

Directions in Therapy
93
Up to this point the usual explanation seems to fit perfectly. Mrs. 
Oak hns been able to look beneath the socially controlled surface of 
her behavior, and finds underneath a murderous feeling of hatred 
and a desire to get even. This is as far as she goes in exploring this 
particular feeling until considerably later in therapy. She picks up 
the theme in the thirty-first interview. She has had a hard time 
getting under way, feels emotionally blocked, and cannot get at 
the feeling which is welling up in her.
C: I have the feeling it isn’t guilt. (Pause. She weeps.) O f course 
I mean, I can’t verbalize it yet. ( Then with a rush of emotion) 
It’s just being terribly hurt!
T : M-hm. It isn’t guilt except in the sense of being very much 
wounded somehow.
C: ( W eeping) It’s — you know, often I’ve been guilty of it my­
self but in later years when I’ve heard parents say to their chil­
dren, “stop crying,” I’ve had a feeling, a hurt as though, well, why 
should they tell them to stop crying? They feel sorry for them­
selves, and who can feel more adequately sorry for himself than 
the child. Well, that is sort of what — I mean, as though I mean, 
I thought that they should let him cry. And — feel sorry for him 
too, maybe. In a rather objective kind of way. Well, that’s — 
that’s something of the kind of thing I’ve been experiencing. I 
mean, now — just right now. And in — in —
T : That catches a little more the flavor of the feeling that it’s al­
most as if you’re really weeping for yourself.
C: Yeah. And again you see there’s conflict. Our culture is such 
that — I mean, one doesn’t indulge in self-pity. But this isn’t — I 
mean, I feel it doesn’t quite have that connotation. It may have.
T : Sort of think that there is a cultural objection to feeling sorry 
about yourself. And yet you feel the feeling you’re experiencing 
isn’t quite what the culture objected to either.
C: And then of course, I’ve come to — to see and to feel that 
over this — see. I’ve covered it up. (W eeps.) But I’ve covered it

T h e P ro cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
up with so much bitterness, which in turn I had to covcr up. 
( Weeping) Thai's what I want to get rid of! I almost don’t care 
if I hurt.
T : (Softly, and with an empathic tenderness toward the hurt she 
is experiencing) You feel that here at the basis of it as you ex­
perience it is a feeling of real tears for yourself. But that you 
can’t show, mustn’t show, so that’s been covered by bitterness that 
you don’t like, that you’d like to be rid of. You almost feel you’d 
rather absorb the hurt than to —  than to feel the bitterness. 
(Pause) And what you seem to be saying quite strongly is, I do 
hurt, and I’ve tried to cover it up.
C: I didn’t know it.
T : M-hm. Like a new discovery really.
C: (Speaking at the same time) I never really did know. But it’s
—  you know, it’s almost a physical thing. It’s —  it’s sort of as 
though I were looking within myself at all kinds of — nerve 
endings and bits of things that have been sort of mashed. (W eep­
ing)
T : As though some of the most delicate aspects of you physically 
almost have been crushed or hurt.
C: Yes. And you know, I do get the feeling, “ Oh, you poor 
thing.” (Pause)
T : Just can’t help but feel very deeply sorry for the person that 
is you.
C: I don’t think I feel sorry for the whole person; it’s a certain 
aspect of the thing.
T : Sorry to see that hurt.
C: Yeah.
T : M-hm. M-hm.
C: And then of course there’s this damn bitterness that I want to 
get rid of. It’s — it gets me into trouble. It’s becausc it’s a tricky 
thing. It tricks me. (Pause)

Directions in Therapy
95
T : Feel as though that bitterness is something you’d like to be rid 
of because it doesn’t do right by you.
C: ( C weeps. Long pause) I don’t know. It seems to me that I’m 
right in feeling, what in the world good would it do to term this 
thing guilt. T o  chase dowr
n things that would give me an interest­
ing case history, shall we say. W hat good would it do? It seems 
to me that the — that the key, the real thing is in this feeling that 
I have.
T : You could track down some tag or other and could make quite 
a pursuit of that, but you feci as though the core of the whole 
thing is the kind of experience that you’re just having right here.
C: That’s right. I mean if — I don’t know what’ll happen to the 
feeling. Maybe nothing. I don’t know, but it seems to me that 
whatever understanding I’m to have is a part of this feeling of hurt, 
of — it doesn’t matter much what it’s called. (Pause) Then I — 
one can’t go — around with a hurt so openly exposed. I mean 
this seems to me that somehow the next process has to be a kind 
of healing.
T : Seems as though you couldn’t possibly expose yourself if part 
of yourself is so hurt, so you wonder if somehow the hurt mustn’t 
be healed first. (Pause)
C: And yet, you know, it’s — it’s a funny thing (pause). It 
sounds like a statement of complete confusion or the old saw that 
the neurotic doesn’t want to give up his symptoms. But that 
isn’t true. I mean, that isn’t true here, but it’s — I can just hope 
that this will impart what I feel. I somehow don’t mind being 
hurt. I mean, it’s just occurred to me that I don’t mind terribly. 
It’s a — I mind more the — the feeling of bitterness which is, I 
know, the cause of this frustration, I mean the —  I somehow mind 
that more.
T : W ould this get it? That, though you don’t like the hurt, yet 
you feel you can accept that. That’s bearable. Somehow it’s the 
things that have covered up that hurt, like the bitterness, that you 
just — at this moment, can’t stand.
C: Yeah. That’s just about it. It’s sort of as though, well, the first,

T h e P r o cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
I mean, as though, it’s — well, it’s something I can cope with. 
Now , the feeling of, well, I can still have a hell of a lot of fun, see. 
But that this other, I mean, this frustration — I mean, it comes out 
in so many ways, I’m beginning to realize, you see. I mean, just 
this sort of, this kind of thing.
T : And a hurt you can accept. It’s a part of life within a lot of 
other parts of life, too. You can have lots of fun. But to have all 
of your life diffused by frustration and bitterness, that you don’t 
like, you don’t want, and are now more aware of.
C: Yeah. And there’s somehow no dodging it now. You see, 
I’m much more aware of it. (Pause) I don’t know. Right now, I 
don’t know just what the next step is. I really don’t know. 
(Pause) Fortunately, this is a kind of development, so that it — 
doesn’t carry over too acutely into — I mean, I —  what I’m trying 
to say, I think, is that I’m still functioning. I’m still enjoying my­
self and —
T : Just sort of want me to know that in lots of ways you carry 
on just as you always have.
C: That’s it. (Pause) Oh, I think I’ve got to stop and go.
In this lengthy excerpt we get a clear picture of the fact that un­
derlying the bitterness and hatred and the desire to get back at the 
world which has cheated her, is a much less anti-social feeling, a 
deep experience of having been hurt. And it is equally clear that at 
this deeper level she has no desire to put her murderous feelings 
into action. She dislikes them and would like to be rid of them.
The next excerpt comes from the thirty-fourth interview. It is 
very incoherent material, as verbalizations often are when the in­
dividual is trying to express something deeply emotional. Here she 
is endeavoring to reach far down into herself. She states that it will 
be difficult to formulate.
C: I don’t know whether I’ll be able to talk about it yet or not. 
Might give it a try. Something —  I mean, it’s a feeling — that — 
sort of an urge to really get out. I know it isn’t going to make 
sense. I think that maybe if I can get it out and get it a little, well,

in a little more matter of fact way, that it’ll be something that’s 
more useful to me. And 1
 don’t know how to — I mean, it seems 
as though I want to say, I want to talk about my self. And that is 
of course as I see, what I’ve been doing for all these hours. But, 
no, this — it’s my self. I’ve quite recently become aware of reject­
ing certain statements, bccause to me they sounded — not quite 
what I meant, I mean, a little bit too idealized. And I mean, I can 
remember always saying it’s more selfish than that, more selfish 
than that. Until I — it sort of occurs to me, it dawns, yeah, that’s 
exactly what I mean, but the selfishness I mean, has an entirely dif­
ferent connotation. I’ve been using a word “selfish.” Then I have 
this feeling of — I — that I’ve never expressed it before, of selfish
—  which means nothing. A — I’m still going to talk about it. A 
kind of pulsation. And it’s something aware all the time. And still 
it’s there. And I’d like to be able to utilize it, too —  as a kind of 
descending into this thing. You know, it’s as though — I don’t 
know, damn! I’d sort of acquired someplace, and picked up a kind 
of acquaintance with the structure. Almost as though I knew it 
brick for brick kind of thing. It’s something that’s an awareness. 
I mean, that — of a feeling of not being fooled, of not being drawn 
into the thing, and a critical sense of knowingness. But in a way
— the reason, it’s hidden and — can’t be a part of everyday life. 
And there’s something of — at times I feel almost a little bit ter­
rible in the thing, but again terrible not as terrible. And why? I 
think I know. And it’s — it also explains a lot to me. It’s — it’s 
something that is totally without hate. I mean, just totally. N ot 
with love, but totally 'without hate. But it’s — it’s an exciting 
thing, too . . .  I guess maybe I am the kind of person that likes 
to, I mean, probably even torment myself, or to chase things 
down, to try to find the whole. And I’ve told myself, now look, 
this is a pretty strong kind of feeling which you have. It isn’t 
constant. But you feel it sometimes, and as you let yourself feel 
it, you feel it yourself. You know, there are words for that kind 
of thing that one could find in abnormal psychology. Might al­
most be like the feeling that is occasionally, is attributed to things 
that you read about. I mean, there are some elements there — I 
mean, this pulsation, this excitement, this knowing. And I’ve said
— I tracked down one thing, I mean, I was very, very brave, what

98
T h e P ro c e ss o f B e c o m in g  a P e r so n
shall we say — a sublimated sex drive. And I thought, well, there 
I’ve got it. I’ve really solved the thing. And that there is nothing 
more to it than that. And for awhile, I mean, I was quite pleased 
with myself. That was it. And then I had to admit, no, that wasn’t 
it. ’Cause that’s something that had been with me long before I 
became so terribly frustrated sexually. I mean, that wasn’t —  and, 
but in the thing, then I began to see a little, within this very core 
is an acceptance of sexual relationship, I mean, the only kind that 
1 would think would be possible. It was in this thing. It’s not 
something that’s been —  I mean, sex hasn’t been sublimated or sub­
stituted there. N o. Within this, within what I know there — I 
mean, it’s a different kind of sexual feeling to be sure. I mean, it’s 
one that is stripped of all the things that have happened to sex, if 
you know what I mean. There’s no chase, no pursuit, no battle, 
no — well, no kind of hate, which I think, seems to me, has crept 
into such things. And yet, I mean, this feeling has been, oh, a little 
bit disturbing.
T : I’d like to see if I can capture a little of what that means to you. 
It is as you’ve gotten very deeply acquainted with yourself on 
kind of a brick-by-brick experiencing basis, and in that sense have 
become more je/f-ish, and the notion of really, — in the discover­
ing of what is the core of you as separate from all the other as­
pects, you come across the realization, which is a very deep and 
pretty thrilling realization, that the core of that self is not only 
without hate, but is really something more resembling a saint, some­
thing really very pure, is the word I would use. And that you can 
try to depreciate that. You can say, maybe it’s a sublimation, 
maybe it’s an abnormal manifestation, screwball and so on. But 
inside of yourself, you knew that it isn’t. This contains the feel­
ings which could contain rich sexual expression, but it sounds 
bigger than, and really deeper than that. And yet fully able to in­
clude all that could be a part of sex expression.
C: It’s probably something like that. . . . It’s kind of — I mean, 
it’s a kind of descent. It’s a going down where you might almost 
think it should be going up, but no, it’s —  I’m sure of it; it’s kind 
of going down.
T : This is a going down and immersing yourself in your self al­
most.

Directions in Therapy
99
C: Yeah. And I — I can’t just throw it aside. I mean, it just seems, 
oh, it just is. I mean, it seems an awfully important thing that I 
just had to say.
T : I’d like to pick up one of those things too, to see if I under­
stand it. That it sounds as though this sort of idea you’re express­
ing is something you must be going up to capture, something that 
isn't quite. Actually though, the feeling is, this is a going down 
to capture something that’s more deeply there.
C: It is. It really — there’s something to that which is — I mean, 
this — I have a way, and of course sometime we’re going to 
have to go into that, of rejecting almost violently, that which 
is righteous, rejection of the ideal, the — as — and that expressed 
it; I mean, that’s sort of what I mean. One is a going up into I 
don’t know. I mean, I just have a feeling, I can’t follow. I mean, 
it’s pretty thin stuff if you ever start knocking it down. This one 
went — I wondered why — I mean, has this awfully definite feel­
ing of descending.
T : That this isn’t a going up into the thin ideal. This is a going 
down into the astonishingly solid reality, that —
C: Yeah.
T :— is really more surprising than —
C: Yeah. I mean, a something that you don’t knock down. That’s 
there — I don’t know — seems to me after you’ve abstracted the 
whole thing. That lasts.. . .
Since this is presented in such confused fashion, it might be worth 
while to draw from it the consecutive themes which she has ex­
pressed.
I’m going to talk about myself as je/f-ish, but with a new connota­
tion to the word.
I’ve acquired an acquaintance with the structure of myself, know 
myself deeply.
As I descend into myself, I discover something exciting, a core 
that is totally without hate.
It can’t be a part of everyday life —  it may even be abnormal.

I thought first it was just a sublimated sex drive.
But no, this is more inclusive, deeper than sex.
One would expect this to be the kind of thing one would dis­
cover by going up into the thin realm of ideals.
But actually, I found it by going deep within myself.
It seems to be something that is the essence, that lasts.
Is this a mystic experience she is describing? It would seem that 
the counselor felt so, from the flavor of his responses. Can we attach 
any significance to such a Gertrude Stein kind of expression? The 
writer would simply point out that many clients have come to a 
somewhat similar conclusion about themselves, though not always 
expressed in such an emotional way. Even Mrs. Oak, in the follow­
ing interview, the thirty-fifth, gives a clearer and more concise state­
ment of her feeling, in a more down-to-earth way. She also explains 
why it was a difficult experience to face.
C: I think I’m awfully glad I found myself or brought myself or 
wanted to talk about self. I mean, it’s a very personal, private kind 
of thing that you just don’t talk about. I mean, I can understand 
my feeling of, oh, probably slight apprehension now. It’s — well, 
sort of as though I was just rejecting, I mean, all of the things 
that western civilization stands for, you see. And wondering 
whether I was right, I mean, whether it was quite the right path, 
and still of course, feeling how right the thing was, you see. And 
so there’s bound to be a conflict. And then this, and I mean, now 
I’m feeling, well, of course that’s how I feel. I mean there's a — 
this thing that I term a kind of a lack of hate, I mean, is very real. 
It carried over into the things I do, I believe in. . . . I think it’s 
all right. It’s sort of maybe my saying to myself, well, you’ve 
been bashing me all over the head, I mean, sort of from the be­
ginning, with superstitions and taboos and misinterpreted doc­
trines and laws and your science, your refrigerators, your atomic 
bombs. But I’m just not buying; you see, I’m just, you just 
haven’t quite succeeded. I think what I’m saying is that, well, I 
mean, just not conforming, and it’s — well, it’s just that way.

that somehow separates you a long ways from your culture, and 
that’s a little frightening, but feels basically good. Is that —
C: Yeah. Well, I have the feeling now that it’s okay, really. . . . 
Then there’s something else — a feeling that’s starting to grow; 
well, to be almost formed, as I say. This kind of conclusion, that 
I’m going to stop looking for something terribly wrong. Now  I 
don’t know why. But I mean, just — it’s this kind of thing. I’m 
sort of saying to myself now, well, in view of what I know, what 
I’ve found — I’m pretty sure I’ve ruled out fear, and I’m positive 
I’m not afraid of shock — I mean, I sort of would have welcomed 
it. But — in view of the places I’ve been, what I learned there, 
then also kind of, well, taking into consideration what I don’t 
know, sort of, maybe this is one of the things that I’ll have to date, 
and say, well, now, I’ve just — I just can’t find it. See? And now 
without any — without, I should say, any sense of apology or 
covering up, just sort of simple statement that I can’t find what at 
this time, appears to be bad.
T : Does this catch it? That as you’ve gone more and more deeply 
into yourself, and as you think about the kind of things that you’ve 
discovered and learned and so on, the conviction grows very, very 
strong that no matter how far you go, the things that you’re going 
to find are not dire and awful. They have a very different charac­
ter.
C: Yes, something like that.
Here, even as she recognizes that her feeling goes against the 
grain of her culture, she feels bound to say that the core of herself 
is not bad, nor terribly wrong, but something positive. Underneath 
the layer of controlled surface behavior, underneath the bitterness, 
underneath the hurt, is a self that is positive, and that is without hate. 
This I believe is the lesson which our clients have been facing us 
with for a long rime, and which we have been slow to learn.
If hatelessness seems like a rather neutral or negative concept, per­

haps we should let Mrs. Oak explain its meaning. In her thirty- 
ninth interview, as she feels her therapy drawing to a close, she re­
turns to this topic.
C: I wonder if I ought to clarify —  it’s clear to me, and perhaps 
that’s all that matters really, here, my strong feeling about a hate- 
free kind of approach. Now  that we have brought it up on a ra­
tional kind of plane, I know —  it sounds negative. And yet in my 
thinking, my — not really my thinking but my feeling, it — and 
my thinking, yes, my thinking, too —  it’s a far more positive thing 
than this —  than a love — and it seems to me a far easier kind of 
a —  it’s less confining. But it — I realize that it must sort of sound 
and almost seem like a complete rejection of so many things, of so 
many creeds and maybe it is. I don’t know. But it just to me seems 
more positive.
T : You can see how it might sound more negative to someone but 
as far as the meaning that it has for you is concerned, it doesn’t 
seem as binding, as possessive I take it, as love. It seems as though 
it actually is more —  more expandable, more usable, than —
C: Yeah.
T : — any of these narrower terms.
C: Really does to me. It’s easier. Well, anyway, it’s easier for me 
to feel that way. And I don’t know. It seems to me to really be 
a way of — of not —  of finding yourself in a place where you 
aren’t forced to make rewards and you aren’t forced to punish. 
It is — it means so much. It just seems to me to make for a kind 
of freedom.
T : Al-hm. M-hm. Where one is rid of the need of either reward­
ing or punishing, then it just seems to you there is so much more 
freedom for all concerned.
C: That’s right. (Pause) I’m prepared for some breakdowns along 
the way.
T : You don’t expect it will be smooth sailing.
C; No.

This section is the story — greatly abbreviated — of one client’s 
discovery that the deeper she dug within herself, the less she had to 
fear; that instead of finding something terribly wrong within her­
self, she gradually uncovered a core of self which wanted neither to 
reward nor punish others, a self without hate, a self which was deeply 
socialized. Do we dare to generalize from this type of experience 
that if we cut through deeply enough to our organismic nature, that 
we find that man is a positive and social animal? This is the sugges­
tion from our clinical experience.
B ein g O n e ’s O r g a n is m , O n e ’s E x p e r ie n c e  
The thread which runs through much of the foregoing material 
of this chapter is that psychotherapy (at least client-centered 
therapy) is a process whereby man becomes his organism — with­
out self-deception, without distortion. W hat does this mean?
W e are talking here about something at an experiential level — 
a phenomenon which is not easily put into words, and which, if 
apprehended only at the verbal level, is by that very fact, already 
distorted. Perhaps if we use several sorts of descriptive formulation, 
it may ring some bell, however faint, in the reader’s experience, and 
cause him to feel “ Oh, now I know, from my own experience, some­
thing of what you are talking about.”
Therapy seems to mean a getting back to basic sensory and vis­
ceral experience. Prior to therapy the person is prone to ask himself, 
often unwittingly, “W hat do others think I should do in this situa­
tion?” “ W hat would my parents or my culture want me to do?” 
“What do I think ought to be done?” He is thus continually acting 
in terms of the form which should be imposed upon his behavior. 
This does not necessarily mean that he always acts in accord with 
the opinions of others. He may indeed endeavor to act so as to con­
tradict the expectations of others. He is nevertheless acting in terms 
of the expectations (often introjected expectations) of others. During 
the process of therapy the individual comes to ask himself, in regard 
to ever-widening areas of his life-space, “ How do I experience this?” 
“W hat does it mean to vie}" “ If I behave in a certain way how do 
I symbolize the meaning which it will have for me?” He comes to 
act on a basis of what may be termed realism — a realistic balancing

104
T h e P r o cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
of the satisfactions and dissatisfactions which any action will bring 
to himself.
Perhaps il will assist those who, like myself, tend to think in con­
crete and clinical terms, if 1
 put some of these ideas into schematized 
formulations of the process through which various clients go. For 
one client this may mean: “ I have thought I must feel only love for 
my parents, but I find that I experience both love and bitter re­
sentment. Perhaps I can be that person who freely experiences both 
love and resentment.” For another client the learning may be: “ I 
have thought I was only bad and worthless. N ow  I experience my­
self at times as one of much worth; at other times as one of little 
worth or usefulness. Perhaps I can be a person who experiences 
varying degrees of worth.” For another: “I have held the concep­
tion that no one could really love me for myself. N ow  I experience 
the affectional warmth of another for me. Perhaps I can be a person 
who is lovable by others — perhaps I am such a person.” For still 
another: “ I have been brought up to feel that I must not appreciate 
myself —  but I do. I can cry for myself, but 1
 can enjoy myself, too. 
Perhaps I am a richly varied person whom I can enjoy and for whom 
I can feel sorry.” Or, to take the last example from Mrs. Oak, “I 
have thought that in some deep way I was bad, that the most basic 
elements in me must be dire and awful. I don’t experience that bad­
ness, but rather a positive desire to live and let live. Perhaps I can be 
that person who is, at heart, positive.”
W hat is it that makes possible anything but the first sentence of 
each of these formulations? 
It is the addition of awareness. In 
therapy the person adds to ordinary experience the full and undis­
torted awareness of his experiencing — of his sensory and visceral 
reactions. He ceases, or at least decreases, the distortions of experi­
ence in awareness. He can be aware of what he is actually experienc­
ing, not simply what he can permit himself to experience after a 
thorough screening through a conceptual filter. In this sense the 
person becomes for the first time the full potential of the human 
organism, with the enriching element of awareness freely added to 
the basic aspect of sensory and visceral reaction. The person comes 
to be what he is, as clients so frequently say in therapy. W hat this 
seems to mean is that the individual comes to be — in awareness —

Directions in Therapy
105
what lie is — in experience. He is, in other words, a complete and 
fully functioning human organism.
Already I can sense the reactions of some of my readers. “ Do you 
mean that as a result of therapy, man becomes nothing but a human 
organism, a human animal? Who will control him? Who will so­
cialize him? Will he then throw over all inhibitions? Have you 
merely released the beast, the id, in man?” To which the most ade­
quate reply seems to be, “ In therapy the individual has actually be­
come a human organism, with all the richness which that implies. 
He is realistically able to control himself, and he is incorrigibly so­
cialized in his desires. There is no beast in man. There is only man 
in man, and this we have been able to release.”
So the basic discovery of psychotherapy seems to me, if our ob­
servations have any validity, that we do not need to be afraid of 
being “merely” homo sapiens. It is the discovery that if we can add 
to the sensory and visceral experiencing which is characteristic of 
the whole animal kingdom, the gift of a free and undistorted aware­
ness of which only the human animal seems fully capable, we have 
an organism which is beautifully and constructively realistic. We 
have then an organism which is as aware of the demands of the cul­
ture as it is of its own physiological demands for food or sex — 
which is just as aware of its desire for friendly relationships as it is of 
its desire to aggrandize itself — which is just as aware of its delicate 
and sensitive tenderness toward others, as it is of its hostilities toward 
others. When man’s unique capacity of awareness is thus functioning 
freely and fully, we find that we have, not an animal whom we must 
fear, not a beast who must be controlled, but an organism able to 
achieve, through the remarkable integrative capacity of its central 
nervous system, a balanced, realistic, self-enhancing, other-enhancing 
behavior as a resultant of all these elements of awareness. T o  put it 
another way, when man is less than fully man —  when he denies to 
awareness various aspects of his experience — then indeed we have 
all too often reason to fear him and his behavior, as the present 
world situation testifies. But when he is most fully man, when he is 
his complete organism, when awareness of experience, that pecu­
liarly human attribute, is most fully operating, then he is to be 
trusted, then his behavior is constructive. It is not always conven­

106
T h e P r o cess o f B e c o m in g  a P erso n
tional. It will not always be conforming. It will be individualized. 
But it will also be socialized.
A C o n c l u d in g C o m m e n t  
I have stated the preceding section as strongly as I am able be­
cause it represents a deep conviction growing out of many years of 
experience. I am quite aware, however, of the difference between 
conviction and truth. I do not ask anyone to agree with my ex­
perience, but only to consider whether the formulation given here 
agrees with his own experience.
N or do I apologize for the speculative character of this paper. 
There is a time for speculation, and a time for the sifting of evidence. 
It is to be hoped that gradually some of the speculations and opinions 
and clinical hunches of this paper may be put to operational and 
definitive test.

his chapter was first given as a talk to a meeting at Oberlin 
College in 1954. / was trying to pull together in more com­
pletely organized form, some of the conceptions of therapy which 
had been growing in me. I have revised it slightly.
As is customary with me, I was trying to keep my thinking close 
to the grass roots of actual experience in therapeutic interviews, so 
I drew heavily upon recorded interviews as the source of the gen­
eralizations which I make.
I
N m y  w o r k  at the Counseling Center of the University of Chi­
cago, I have the opportunity of working with people who present 
a wide variety of personal problems. There is the student concerned 
about failing in college; the housewife disturbed about her marriage; 
the individual who feels he is teetering on the edge of a complete 
breakdown or psychosis; the responsible professional man who 
spends much of his time in sexual fantasies and functions inefficiently 
107

T h e P r o cess o f B e c o m in g  a P l k s o n
in his work; the brilliant student, at the top of his class, who is para­
lyzed by the conviction that he is hopelessly and helplessly inade­
quate; the parent who is distressed by his child’s behavior; the pop­
ular girl who finds herself unaccountably overtaken by sharp spells 
of black depression; the woman who fears that life and love are 
passing her by, and that her good graduate record is a poor recom­
pense; the man who has become convinced that powerful or sinister 
forccs are plotting against him; —  I could go on and on with the 
many different and unique problems which people bring to us. They 
run the gamut of life’s experiences. Yet there is no satisfaction in 
giving this type of catalog, for, as counselor, I know that the prob­
lem as stated in the first interview will not be the problem as seen in 
the second or third hour, and by the tenth interview it will be a still 
different problem or series of problems.
I have however come to believe that in spite of this bewildering 
horizontal multiplicity, and the layer upon layer of vertical com­
plexity, there is perhaps only one problem. As I follow the ex­
perience of many clients in the therapeutic relationship which we 
endeavor to create for them, it seems to me that each one is raising 
the same question. Below the level of the problem situation about 
which the individual is complaining — behind the trouble with 
studies, or wife, or employer, or with his own uncontrollable or 
bizarre behavior, or with his frightening feelings, lies one central 
search. It seems to me that at bottom each person is asking, “Who 
am I, really? How can I get in touch with this real self, underlying 
all my surface behavior? How can I become myself?”

Let me try to explain what I mean when I say that it appears that 
the goal the individual most wishes to achieve, the end which he 
knowingly and unknowingly pursues, is to becomc himself.
When a person comes to me, troubled by his unique combination 
of difficulties, I have found it most worth while to try to create a 
relationship with him in which he is safe and free. It is my purpose

What It Means to Become a Person
109
to understand the way he feels in his own inner world, to accept him 
as he is, to create an atmosphere of freedom in which he can move 
in his thinking and feeling and being, in any direction he desires. 
How does he use this freedom?
It is my experience that he uses it to become more and more him­
self. He begins to drop the false fronts, or the masks, or the roles, 
with which he has faced life. He appears to be trying to discover 
something more basic, something more truly himself. At first he lays 
aside masks which he is to some degree aware of using. One young 
woman student describes in a counseling interview one of the masks 
she has been using, and how uncertain she is whether underneath 
this appeasing, ingratiating front there is any real self with convic­
tions.
I was thinking about this business of standards. I somehow de­
veloped a sort of knack, I guess, of — well — habit — of trying to 
make people feel at ease around me, or to make things go along 
smoothly. There always had to be some appeaser around, being 
sorta the oil that soothed the waters. At a small meeting, or a little 
party, or something — I could help things go along nicely and 
appear to be having a good time. And sometimes I’d surprise my­
self by arguing against what I really thought when I saw that the 
person in charge would be quite unhappy about it if I didn’t. In 
other words I just wasn’t ever —  I mean, I didn’t find myself ever 
being set and definite about things. N ow  the reason why I did it 
probably was I’d been doing it around home so much. I just didn’t 
stand up for my own convictions, until I don’t know whether I 
have any convictions to stand up for. I haven’t been really hon­
estly being myself, or actually knowing what my real self is, and 
I’ve been just playing a sort of false role.
You can, in this excerpt, see her examining the mask she has been 
using, recognizing her dissatisfaction with it, and wondering how to 
get to the real self underneath, if such a self exists.
In this attempt to discover his own self, the client typically uses 
the relationship to explore, to examine the various aspects of his own 
experience, to recognize and face up to the deep contradictions 
which he often discovers. He learns how much of his behavior,

110
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a  P e r s o n
even how much of the feeling he experiences, is not real, is not 
something which flows from the genuine reactions of his organism, 
but is a fagade, a front, behind which he has been hiding. He dis­
covers how much of his life is guided by what he thinks he should 
be, not by what he is. Often he discovers that he exists only in re­
sponse to the demands of others, that he seems to have no self of his 
own, that he is only trying to think, and feel, and behave in the way 
that others believe he ought to think, and feel and behave.
In this connection I have been astonished to find how accurately 
the Danish philosopher, S0ren Kierkegaard, pictured the dilemma of 
the individual more than a century ago, with keen psychological in­
sight. He points out that the most common despair is to be in 
despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself; but that the deepest 
form of despair is to choose “ to be another than himself.” On the 
other hand “ to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the 
opposite of despair,” and this choice is the deepest responsibility of 
man. As I read some of his writings I almost feel that he must have 
listened in on the statements made by our clients as they search and 
explore for the reality of self — often a painful and troubling search.
This exploration becomes even more disturbing when they find 
themselves involved in removing the false faces which they had not 
known were false faces. They begin to engage in the frightening 
task of exploring the turbulent and sometimes violent feelings with­
in themselves. T o remove a mask which you had thought was part 
of your real self can be a deeply disturbing experience, yet when 
there is freedom to think and feel and be, the individual moves to­
ward such a goal. A few statements from a person who had com­
pleted a series of psychotherapeutic interviews, will illustrate this. 
She uses many metaphors as she tells how she struggled to get to 
the core of herself.
As I look at it now, I was peeling off layer after layer of defenses. 
I’d build them up, try them, and then discard them when you re­
mained the same. I didn’t know what was at the bottom and I 
was very much afraid to find out, but I had to keep on trying. At 
first I felt there was nothing within me — just a great emptiness 
where I needed and wanted a solid core. Then I began to feel thiit

What It Means to Become a Person
1 11
I was facing a solid brick wall, too high to get over and too thick 
to go through. One day the wall became translucent, rather 
than solid. After this, the wall seemed to disappear but beyond 
it I discovered a dam holding back violent, churning waters. I 
felt as if I were holding back the force of these waters and if I 
opened even a tiny hole I and all about me would be destroyed in 
the ensuing torrent of feelings represented by the water. Finally 
I could stand the strain no longer and I let go. All I did, actually, 
was to succumb to complete and utter self pity, then hate, then 
love. After this experience, I felt as if I had leaped a brink and 
was safely on the other side, though still tottering a bit on the 
edge. I don’t know what I was searching for or where I was going, 
but I felt then as I have always felt whenever I really lived, that 
I was moving forward.
I believe this represents rather well the feelings of many an in­
dividual that if the false front, the wall, the dam, is not maintained, 
then everything will be swept away in the violence of the feelings 
that he discovers pent-up in his private world. Yet it also illustrates 
the compelling necessity which the individual feels to search for and 
become himself. It also begins to indicate the way in which the 
individual determines the reality in himself —  that when he fully 
experiences the feelings which at an organic level he is, ns this client 
experienced her self-pity, hatred, and love, then he feels an assurance 
that he is being a part of his real self.
T h e E x p e r ie n c in g  o f F e e l in g  
I would like to say something more about this experiencing of 
feeling. It is really the discovery of unknown elements of self. The 
phenomenon I am trying to describe is something which I think is 
quite difficult to get across in any meaningful way. In our daily 
lives there are a thousand and one reasons for not letting ourselves 
experience our attitudes fully, reasons from our past and from the 
present, reasons that reside within the social situation. It seems too 
dangerous, too potentially damaging, to experience them freely and 
fully. But in the safety and freedom of the therapeutic relationship, 
they can be experienced fully, clear to the limit of what they are. 
They can be and are experienced in a fashion that I like to think of

112
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
as a “pure culture,” so that for the moment the person is his fear, or 
he is his anger, or he is his tenderness, or whatever.
Perhaps again I can clarify this by giving an example from a client 
which will indicate and convey something of what I mean. A young 
man, a graduate student who is deep in therapy, has been puzzling 
over a vague feeling which he senses in himself. He gradually 
identifies it as a frightened feeling of some kind, a fear of failing, a 
fear of not getting his Ph.D. Then comes a long pause. From this 
point on we will let the recorded interview speak for itself.
Client: I was kinda letting it seep through. But I also tied it in with 
you and with my relationship with you. And that’s one thing I 
feel about it is kind of a fear of it going away; or that’s another 
thing — it’s so hard to get hold of — there’s kind of two pulling 
feelings about it. Or two “ me’s” somehow. One is the scared one 
that wants to hold on to things, and that one I guess I can feel 
pretty clearly right now. You know, I kinda need things to hold 
on to —  and I feel kinda scared.
Therapist: M-hm. That’s something you can feel right this min­
ute, and have been feeling and perhaps are feeling in regard to 
our relationship, too.
C: W on’t you let me have this, because, you know, I kinda need 
it. I can be so lonely and scared without it.
T : M-hm, m-hm. Let me hang on to this because I’d be terribly 
scared if I didn’t. Let me hold on to it. (Pause)
C: It’s kinda the same thing — Won’t you let me have my thesis or 
my Ph.D- so then . . . ’Cause I kinda need that little world. I 
mean___
T : In both instances it’s kind of a pleading thing too, isn’t it? 
Let me have this because I need it badly. I’d be awfully frightened 
without it. (Long pause.)
C: I get a sense of . . .  I can’t somehow get much further . . . It’s 
this kind of pleading little boy, somehow, even . . . W hat’s this 
gesture of begging? (Putting his hands together as if in prayer) 
Isn’t it funny? ’Cause th at. . .

What It Means to Become a Verson
113
T : You put your hands in sort of a supplication.
C: Ya, that’s right! W on’t you do this for me, kinda . . . Oh,
that’s terrible! Who, me, beg?
Perhaps this excerpt will convey a bit of the thing I have been 
talking about, the experiencing of a feeling all the way to the limit. 
Here he is, for a moment, experiencing himself as nothing but a 
pleading little boy, supplicating, begging, dependent. At that mo­
ment he is nothing but his plcadingness, all the way through. T o  be 
sure he almost immediately backs away from this experiencing by 
saying “Wrho, me, beg?” but it has left its mark. As he says a 
moment later, “ It’s such a wondrous thing to have these new things 
come out of me. It amazes me so much each time, and then again 
there’s that same feeling, kind of feeling scared that I’ve so much 
of this that I’m keeping back or something.” He realizes that this 
has bubbled through, and that for the moment he is his dependency, 
in a way which astonishes him.
It is not only dependency that is experienced in this all-out kind 
of fashion. It may be hurt, or sorrow, or jealousy, or destructive 
anger, or deep desire, or confidence and pride, or sensitive tender­
ness, or outgoing love. It may be any of the emotions of which man 
is capable.
\Vrhat I have gradually learned from experiences such as this, is 
that the individual in such a moment, is coming to be what he is. 
When a person has, throughout therapy, experienced in this fashion 
all the emotions which organismically arise in him, and has ex­
perienced them in this knowing and open manner, then he has 
experienced himself, in all the richness that exists within himself. He 
has become what he is.
T h e D isco v ery o f S e l f  in  E x p e r ie n c e
Let us pursue a bit further this question of what it means to be­
come one’s self. It is a most perplexing question and again I will 
try to take from a statement by a client, written between interviews, 
a suggestion of an answer. She tells how the various facades by 
which she has been living have somehow crumpled and collapscd,

114
T h e  P r o c e s s  o f  B e c o m in g  a  P e r s o n
bringing a feeling of confusion, but also a feeling of relief. She 
continues:
You know, it seems as if all the energy that went into holding 
the arbitrary pattern together was quite unnecessary — a waste. 
You think you have to make the pattern yourself; but there are so 
many pieces, and it’s so hard to see where they fit. Sometimes you 
put them in the wrong place, and the more pieces mis-fitted, the 
more effort it takes to hold them in place, until at last you are 
so tired that even that awful confusion is better than holding on 
any longer. Then you discover that left to themselves the jumbled 
pieces fall quite naturally into their own places, and a living pat­
tern emerges without any effort at all on your part. Your job is 
just to discover it, and in the course of that, you will find your­
self and your own place. You must even let your own experience 
tell you its own meaning; the minute you tell it what it means, you 
are at war with yourself.
Let me see if I can take her poetic expression and translate it into 
the meaning it has for me. I believe she is saying that to be herself 
means to find the pattern, the underlying order, which exists in the 
ceaselessly changing flow of her experience. Rather than to try to 
hold her experience into the form of a mask, or to make it be a form 
or structure that it is not, being herself means to discover the unity 
and harmony which exists in her own actual feelings and reactions. 
It means that the real self is something which is comfortably dis­
covered in one’s experiences, not something imposed upon it.
Through giving excerpts from the statements of these clients, I 
have been trying to suggest what happens in the warmth and under­
standing of a facilitating relationship with a therapist. It seems that 
gradually, painfully, the individual explores what is behind the masks 
he presents to the world, and even behind the masks with which he 
has been deceiving himself. Deeply and often vividly he experiences 
the various elements of himself which have been hidden within. 
Thus to an increasing degree he becomes himself —  not a fagade of 
conformity to others, not a cynical denial of all feeling, nor a front 
of intellectual rationality, but a living, breathing, feeling, fluctuating 
process — in short, he becomes a person.

I imagine that some of you are asking, “But what kind of a person 
does he become? It isn’t enough to say that he drops the fa£ades. 
What kind of person lies underneath?” Since one of the most ob­
vious facts is that each individual tends to become a separate and 
distinct and unique person, the answer is not easy. However I would 
like to point out some of the characteristic trends which I see. N o 
one person would fully exemplify these characteristics, no one per­
son fully achives the description I will give, but I do see certain 
generalizations which can be drawn, based upon living a therapeutic 
relationship with many clients.
O p e n n e s s to E x p e r ie n c e
First of all I would say that in this process the individual becomes 
more open to his experience. This is a phrase which has come to 
have a great deal of meaning to me. It is the opposite of defensive­
ness. Psychological research has shown that if the evidence of our 
senses runs contrary to our picture of self, then that evidence is dis­
torted. In other words we cannot see all that our senses report, but 
only the things which fit the picture we have.
Now  in a safe relationship of the sort I have described, this de­
fensiveness or rigidity, tends to be replaced by an increasing open­
ness to experience. The individual becomes more openly aware of 
his own feelings and attitudes as they exist in him at an organic level, 
in the way I tried to describe. He also becomes more aware of reality 
as it exists outside of himself, instead of perceiving it in precon­
ceived categories. He sees that not all trees are green, not all men 
are stem fathers, not all women are rejecting, not all failure experi­
ences prove that he is no good, and the like. He is able to take in the 
evidence in a new situation, as it isy
 rather than distorting it to fit 
a pattern which he already holds. As you might expect, this increas­
ing ability to be open to experience makes him far more realistic in 
dealing with new people, new situations, new problems. It means 
that his beliefs are not rigid, that he can tolerate ambiguity. He can 
receive much conflicting evidence without forcing closure upon the

116
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
situation. This openness of awareness to what exists at this moment 
in oneself and in the situation is, I believe, an important element in 
the description of the person who emerges from therapy.
Perhaps I can give this concept a more vivid meaning if I illus­
trate it from a recorded interview. A young professional man re­
ports in the 48th interview the way in which he has become more 
open to some of his bodily sensations, as well as other feelings.
C: It doesn’t seem to me that it would be possible for anybody to 
relate all the changes that you feel. But I certainly have felt re­
cently that I have more respect for, more objectivity toward my 
physical makeup. I mean I don’t expect too much of myself. This 
is how it works out: It feels to me that in the past I used to fight 
a certain tiredness that I felt after supper. Well, now I feel pretty 
sure that I really am tired — that I am not making myself tired — 
that I am just physiologically lower. It seemed that I was just 
constantly criticizing my tiredness.
T : So you can let yourself be tired, instead of feeling along with 
it a kind of criticism of it.
C: Yes, that I shouldn’t be tired or something. And it seems in a 
way to be pretty profound that I can just not fight this tiredness, 
and along with it goes a real feeling of I've got to slow down, too, 
so that being tired isn’t such an awful thing. I think I can also 
kind of pick up a thread here of why I should be that way in the 
way my father is and the way he looks at some of these things. 
For instance, say that I was sick, and I would report this, and it 
would seem that overtly he would want to do something about it 
but he would also communicate, “Oh, my gosh, more trouble.” 
You know, something like that.
T : As though there were something quite annoying really about 
being physically ill.
C: Yeah, I’m sure that my father has the same disrespect for his 
own physiology that I have had. N ow  last summer I twisted my 
back, I wrenched it, I heard it snap and everything. There was 
real pain there all the time at first, real sharp. And I had the doctor 
look at it and he said it wasn’t serious, it should heal by itself as

What It Means to Become a Person
117
long as I didn’t bend too much. Well this was months ago — and 
I have been noticing recently that — hell, this is a real pain and 
it’s still there — and it’s not my fault.
T : It doesn’t prove something bad about you —
C: N o —  and one of the reasons I seem to get more tired than I 
should maybe is because of this constant strain, and so — I have 
already made an appointment with one of the doctors at the 
hospital that he would look at it and take an X ray or something. 
In a way I guesss you could say that I am just more accurately 
sensitive — or objectively sensitive to this kind of thing. . . . And 
this is really a profound change as I say, and of course my rela­
tionship with my wife and the two children is —  well, you just 
wouldn’t recognize it if you could see me inside — as you have — 
I mean — there just doesn’t seem to be anything more wonderful 
than really and genuinely — really feelbig love for your own 
children and at the same time receiving it. I don’t know how to 
put this. W e have such an increased respect — both of us — for 
Judy and we’ve noticed just — as we participated in this — we 
have noticed such a tremendous change in her — it seems to be a 
pretty deep kind of thing.
T : It seems to me you are saying that you can listen more ac­
curately to yourself. If your body says it’s tired, you listen to it 
and believe it, instead of criticizing it; if it’s in pain, you can lis­
ten to that; if the feeling is really loving your wife or children, 
you can feel that, and it seems to show up in the differences in 
them too.
Here, in a relatively minor but symbolically important excerpt, 
can be seen much of what I have been trying to say about openness 
to experience. Formerly he could not freely feel pain or illness, 
becausc being ill meant being unacceptable. Neither could he feel 
tenderness and love for his child, because such feelings meant being 
weak, and he had to maintain his facade of being strong. But now 
he can be genuinely open to the experiences of his organism — he 
can be tired when he is tired, he can feel pain when his organism 
is in pain, he can freely experience the love he feels for his daughter.

118

h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
and he can also feel and express annoyance toward her, as he goes on 
to say in the next portion of the interview. He can fully live the 
experiences of his total organism, rather than shutting them out of 
awareness.
T r u st  in O n e ’s O r g a n ism
A second characteristic of the persons who emerge from therapy 
is difficult to describe. It seems that the person increasingly dis­
covers that his own organism is trustworthy, that it is a suitable in­
strument for discovering the most satisfying behavior in each im­
mediate situation.
If this seems strange, let me try to state it more fully. Perhaps it 
will help to understand my description if you think of the individual 
as faced with some existential choice: “ Shall I go home to my family 
during vacation, or strike out on my own?” “Shall I drink this third 
cocktail which is being offered?” “Is this the person whom I would 
like to have as my partner in love and in life?” Thinking of such 
situations, what seems to be true of the person who emerges from 
the therapeutic process? T o the extent that this person is open to 
all of his experience, he has access to all of the available data in the 
situation, on which to base his behavior. He has knowledge of his 
own feelings and impulses, which are often complex and contradic­
tory. He is freely able to sense the social demands, from the rela­
tively rigid social “ laws” to the desires of friends and family. He 
has access to his memories of similar situations, and the consequences 
of different behaviors in those situations. He has a relatively accurate 
perception of this external situation in all of its complexity. He is 
better able to permit his total organism, his conscious thought par­
ticipating, to consider, weigh and balance each stimulus, need, and 
demand, and its relative weight and intensity. Out of this complex 
weighing and balancing he is able to discover that course of action 
which seems to come closest to satisfying all his needs in the situa­
tion, long-range as well as immediate needs.
In such a weighing and balancing of all of the components of a 
given life choice, his organism would not by any means be infallible. 
Mistaken choices might be made. But because he tends to be open 
to his experience, there is a greater and more immediate awareness

What It Means to Become a Person
119
of unsatisfying consequences, a quicker correction of choices which 
are in error.
It may help to realize that in most of us the defects which interfere 
with this weighing and balancing are that we include things that are 
not a part of our experience, and exclude elements which are. Thus 
an individual may persist in the concept that “ I can handle liquor,” 
when openness to his past experience would indicate that this is 
scarcely correct. Or a young woman may see only the good quali­
ties of her prospective mate, where an openness to experience would 
indicate that he possesses faults as well.
In general then, it appears to be true that when a client is open 
to his experience, he comes to find his organism more trustworthy. 
He feels less fear of the emotional reactions which he has. There 
is a gradual growth of trust in, and even affection for the complex, 
rich, varied assortment of feelings and tendencies which exist in liim 
at the organic level. Consciousness, instead of being the watchman 
over a dangerous and unpredictable lot of impulses, of which few 
can be permitted to see the light of day, becomes the comfortable 
inhabitant of a society of impulses and feelings and thoughts, which 
are discovered to be very satisfactorily self-governing when not 
fearfully guarded.
An I n t e r n a l Locus o f E v a lu a tio n
Another trend which is evident in this process of becoming a per­
son relates to the source or locus of choices and decisions, or evalua­
tive judgments. The individual increasingly comes to feel that this 
locus of evaluation lies within himself. Less and less does he look 
to others for approval or disapproval; for standards to live bv; for 
decisions and choices. He recognizes that it rests within himself to 
choose; that the only question which matters is, “ Am I living in a 
way which is deeply satisfying to me, and which truly expresses 
me?” This I think is perhaps the most important question for the 
creative individual.
Perhaps it will help if I give an illustration. I would like to give a 
brief portion of a recorded interview with a young woman, a 
graduate student, who had come for counseling help. She was ini­
tially very much disturbed about many problems, and had been

120
T h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
contemplating suicide. During the interview one of the feelings she 
discovered was her great desire to be dependent, just to let someone 
else take over the direction of her life. She was very critical of those 
who had not given her enough guidance. She talked about one after 
another of her professors, feeling bitterly that none of them had 
taught her anything with deep meaning. Gradually she began to 
realize that part of the difficulty was the fact that she had taken no 
initiative in participating in these classes. Then comes the portion I 
wish to quote.
I think you will find that this excerpt gives you some indication 
of what it means in experience to accept the locus of evaluation as 
being within oneself. Here then is the quotation from one of the 
later interviews with this young woman as she has begun to realize 
that perhaps she is partly responsible for the deficiencies in her own 
education.
C: W ell now, I wonder if I’ve been going around doing that, 
getting smatterings of things, and not getting hold, not really get­
ting down to things.
T: Maybe you’ve been getting just spoonfuls here and there 
rather than really digging in somewhere rather deeply.
C: M-hm. That’s why I say — (slon'ly and very thoughtfully) 
well, with that sort of a foundation, well, it’s really up to vie. I 
mean, it seems to be really apparent to me that I can’t depend on 
someone else to give me an education. ( Very softly) I’ll really 
have to get it myself.
T : It really begins to come home — there’s only one person that 
can educate you — a realization that perhaps nobody else can give 
you an education.
C: M-hm. (Long pause — while she sits thinking) I have all the 
symptoms of fright. (Laughs softly)
T: Fright? That this is a scary thing, is that what you mean?
C: M-hm. (Very long pause —  obviously struggling with feel­
ings in herself).

What It Means to Become a Person
121
T : Do you want to say any more about what you mean by that? 
That it really docs give you the symptoms of fright?
C: (Laughs) 
I, uh — 1
 don’t know whether I quite know. I 
mean — well it really seems like I’m cut loose (pause), and it 
seems that I'm very — I don’t know —  in a vulnerable position, 
but I, uh, I brought this up and it, uh, somehow it almost came 
out without my saying it. 
It seems to be — it’s something 1
 let 
out.
T : Hardly a part of you.
C: Well, I felt surprised.
T : As though, “ Well for goodness sake, did I say that?” (Both 
chuckle.)
C: Really, I don’t think I’ve had that feeling before. I’ve — uh, 
well, this really feels like I'm saying something that, uh, is a part 
of me really. (Pause) Or, uh, (quite perplexed) it feels like I sort 
of have, uh, I don’t know. I have a feeling of strength, and yet, I 
have a feeling of — realizing it’s so sort of fearful, of fright.
TV That is, do you mean that saying something of that sort gives 
you at the same time a feeling of, of strength in saying it, and yet 
at the same time a frightened feeling of what you have said, is 
that it?
C: M-hm. I am feeling that. For instance, I'm feeling it internally 
now — a sort of surging up, or force or outlet. As if that’s some­
thing really big and strong. And yet, uh, well at first it was al­
most a physical feeling of just being out alone, and sort of cut off 
from a — a support I had been carrying around.
T : You feel that it’s something deep and strong, and surging 
forth, and at the same time, you just feel as though you’d cut 
yourself loose from any support when you say it.
C: M-hm. Maybe that’s — I don’t know — it’s a disturbance of a 
kind of pattern I’ve been carrying around, I think.
T : It sort of shakes a rather significant pattern, jars it loose.
C: M-hm. 
(Pause, then cautiously, but with conviction) I, I

122
T h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
think —  I don’t know, but I have the feeling that then I am going 
to begin to do more things that I know I should do. . . . There are 
so many things that I need to do. It seems in so many avenues of 
my living I have to work out new ways of behavior, but — maybe
— I can see myself doing a little better in some things
I hope that this illustration gives some sense of the strength which 
is experienced in being a unique person, responsible for oneself, and 
also the uneasiness that accompanies this assumption of responsibility. 
T o recognize that “ I am the one who chooses” and “ I am the one 
who determines the value of an experience for me” is both an in­
vigorating and a frightening realization.
W il l in g n e s s to b e a P r o cess
I should like to point out one final characteristic of these individ­
uals as they strive to discover and become themselves. It is that the 
individual seems to become more content to be a process rather than 
a product. When he enters the therapeutic relationship, the client 
is likely to wish to achieve some fixed state: he wants to reach the 
point where his problems are solved, or where he is effective in his 
work, or where his marriage is satisfactory. He tends, in the free­
dom of the therapeutic relationship to drop such fixed goals, and to 
accept a more satisfying realization that he is not a fixed entity, but 
a process of becoming.
One client, at the conclusion of therapy, says in rather puzzled 
fashion, “ I haven’t finished the job of integrating and reorganizing 
myself, but that’s only confusing, not discouraging, now that I real­
ize this is a continuing process.. . . It’s exciting, sometimes upsetting, 
but deeply encouraging to feel yourself in action, apparently know­
ing where you are going even though you don’t always consciously 
know where that is.” One can see here both the expression of trust 
in the organism, whic h I have mentioned, and also the realization of 
self as a process. Here is a personal description of what it seems like 
to accept oneself as a stream of becoming, not a finished product. 
It means that a person is a fluid process, not a fixed and static entity; 
a flowing river of change, not a block of solid material; a continually 
changing constellation of potentialities, not a fixed quantity of traits

What It Means to Become a Person
123
Here is another statement of this same element of fluidity or exis­
tential living, “This whole train of experiencing, and the meanings 
that I have thus far discovered in it, seem to have launched me on a 
process which is both fascinating and at times a little frightening. 
It seems to mean letting my experiences carry me on, in a direction 
which appears to be forward, towards goals that I can but dimly 
define, as I try to understand at least the current meaning of that 
experience. The sensation is that of floating with a complex stream 
of experience, with the fascinating possibility of trying to compre­
hend its ever-changing complexity.”
C o n c l u s io n
I have tried to tell you what has seemed to occur in the lives of 
people with whom I have had the privilege of being in a relationship 
as they struggled toward becoming themselves. I have endeavored 
to describe, as accurately as I can, the meanings which seem to be 
involved in this process of becoming a person. I am sure that this 
process is not one that occurs only in therapy. I am sure that I do 
not see it clearly or completely, since I keep changing my compre­
hension and understanding of it. I hope you will accept it as a cur­
rent and tentative picture, not as something final.
One reason for stressing the tentative nature of what I have said 
is that I wish to make it clear that I am not saying, “This is what you 
should become; here is the goal for you.” Rather, I am saying that 
these are some of the meanings I see in the experiences that my 
clients and I have shared. Perhaps this picture of the experience of 
others may illuminate or give more meaning to some of your own 
experience.
I have pointed out that each individual appears to be asking a 
double question: “W ho am I?” and “ H ow  may I become myself?” I 
have stated that in a favorable psychological climate a process of 
becoming takes place; that here the individual drops one after an­
other of the defensive masks with which he has faced life; that he 
experiences fully the hidden aspects of himself; that he discovers in 
these experiences the stranger who has been living behind these

124
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
masks, the stranger who is himself. I have tried to give my picture 
of the characteristic attributes of the person who emerges; a person 
who is more open to all of the elements of his organic experience; a 
person who is developing a trust in his own organism as an instru­
ment of sensitive living; a person who accepts the locus of evaluation 
as residing within himself; a person who is learning to live in his life 
as a participant in a fluid, ongoing process, in which he is continually 
discovering new aspects of himself in the flow of his experience. 
These are some of the elements which seem to me to be involved in 
becoming a person.

A Proccss Conception 
of Psychotherapy
I
n the autumn of 1956 I was greatly honored by the American Psy­
chological Association, which bestowed upon me one of its first 
three Distinguished Scientific Contribution Awards. There was how­
ever a penalty attached to the award, which was that one year later, 
each recipient was to present a paper to the Association. It did not 
appeal to me to review work which we had done in the past. I de­
cided rather to devote the year to a fresh attempt to understand the 
process by which personality changes. I did thisy
 but as the next 
autumn approached, / realized that the ideas I had formed were still 
unclear, tentative, hardly in shape for presentation. Nevertheless I 
tried to set down the jumbled sensings which had been important 
to mej out of which was emerging a concept of process different 
from anything I had clearly perceived before. When I had finished 
I found I had a paper much too long to deliver, so I cut it down to 
an abbreviated form for presentation on September 2, 1951 to the 
American Psychological Convention in N ew  York. 
The present 
chapter is neither as long as the initial formy
 nor as abbreviated as 
the second form.
It will be discovered that though the two preceding chapters 
view the process of therapy almost entirely from a phenomenological 
point of view, from within the client's frame of reference, this for- 
125

126
T h e  P r o c e s s  o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
vmlation endeavors to capture those qualities of expression ’which 
may be observed by anothery
 and hence views it more from an ex­
ternal frame of reference.
Out of the observations recorded in this paper a “Scale of Process 
in Psychotherapy” has been developed which can be applied opera­
tionally to excerpts from recorded interviews. It is still in process of 
revision and improvement. Even in its present form it has reasonable 
inter-judge reliability, and gives meaningful results. Cases which by 
other criteria are known to be more successful show greater move- 
vient on the Process Scale than less successful cases. Also, to our 
surprise it has been found that successful cases begin at a higher 
level on the Process Scale than do unsuccessful cases. Evidently we 
do not yet know, with any satisfactory degree of assurance, how to 
be of therapeutic help to individuals whose behavior when they come 
to us is typical of stages one and two as described in this chapter. 
Thus the ideas of this paper, poorly formed and incomplete as they 
seemed to me at the time, are already opening up new and chal­
lenging areas for thought and investigation.

 w o u ld  l i k e  to take you  w ith m e on a journey of exploration. 
T h e object o f the trip, the goal of the search, is to try to learn 
som ething of the process o f psychotherapy, or the process by w hich 
personality change takes place. I w ould warn you that the goal has 
not yet been achieved, and that it seems as though the expedition 
has advanced only a few  short miles into the jungle. Yet perhaps if 
I can take you w ith me, you w ill be tem pted to discover new  and 
profitable avenues o f further advance.
M y ow n reason for engaging in such a search seems simple to me. 
Just as m any psychologists have been interested in the invariant as­
pects o f personality —  the unchanging aspects of intelligence, tem ­
perament, personality structure —  so I have long been interested in

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
127
the invariant aspects of change in personality. Do personality and 
behavior change? W hat commonalities exist in such changes? W hat 
commonalities exist in the conditions which precede change? Most 
important of all, what is the process by which such change occurs?
Until recently we have for the most part tried to learn something 
of this process by studying outcomes. W e have many facts, for 
example, regarding the changes which take place in self-perception, 
or in perception of others. W e have not only measured these 
changes over the whole course of therapy, but at intervals during 
therapy. Yet even this last gives us little clue as to the process in­
volved. Studies of segmented outcomes are still measures of out­
come, giving little knowledge of the w ay in which the change takes 
place.
Puzzling over this problem of getting at the process has led me 
to realize how little objective research deals with process in any 
field. Objective research slices through the frozen moment to pro­
vide us with an exact picture of the inter-relationships which exist 
at that moment. But our understanding of the ongoing movement — 
whether it be the process of fermentation, or the circulation of the 
blood, or the process of atomic fission —  is generally provided by a 
theoretical formulation, often supplemented, where feasible, with a 
clinical observation of the process. I have thus come to realize that 
perhaps I am hoping for too much to expect that research procedures 
can shed light directly upon the process of personality change. Per­
haps only theory can do that.
A R e je c t e d  M eth o d
When I determined, more than a year ago, to make a fresh attempt 
to understand the way in which such change takes place, I first con­
sidered various ways in which the experience of therapy might be 
described in terms of some other theoretical framework. There 
was much that was appealing in the field of communication theory, 
with its concepts of feedback, input and output signals, and the like. 
There was the possibility of describing the process of therapy in 
terms of learning theory, or in terms of general systems theory. As 
I studied these avenues of understanding I became convinced that 
it would be possible to translate the process of psychotherapy into

128
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
any one of these theoretical frameworks. It would, I believe, have 
certain advantages to do so. But I also became convinced that in a 
field so new, this is not what is most needed.
I came to a conclusion which others have reached before, that in 
a new field perhaps what is needed first is to steep oneself in the 
events, to approach the phenomena with as few preconceptions as 
possible, to take a naturalist’s observational, descriptive approach to 
these events, and to draw forth those low-level inferences which 
seem most native to the material itself.
T h e M ode o f A ppro ach
So, for the past year, I have used the method which so many of 
us use for generating hypotheses, a method which psychologists in 
this country seem so reluctant to expose or comment on. I used 
myself as a tool.
As a tool, I have qualities both good and bad. For many years I 
have experienced therapy as a therapist. I have experienced it on 
the other side of the desk as a client. I have thought about therapy, 
carried on research in this field, been intimately acquainted with the 
research of others. But I have also formed biases, have come to have 
a particular slant on therapy, have tried to develop theoretical ab­
stractions regarding therapy. These views and theories would tend 
to make me less sensitive to the events themselves. Could I open my­
self to the phenomena of therapy freshly, naively? Could I let the 
totality of m y experience be as effective a tool as it might potentially 
be, or would my biases prevent me from seeing what was there? I 
could only go ahead and make the attempt.
So, during this past year I have spent many hours listening to re­
corded therapeutic interviews —  trying to listen as naively as pos­
sible. I have endeavored to soak up all the clues I could capture as 
to the process, as to what elements are significant in change. Then 
I have tried to abstract from that sensing the simplest abstractions 
which would describe them. Here I have been much stimulated and 
helped by the thinking of many of my colleagues, but I would like 
to mention my special indebtedness to Eugene Gendlin, William 
Kirtner and Fred Zimring, whose demonstrated ability to think in

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
129
new ways about these matters has been particularly helpful, and 
from whom I have borrowed heavily.
The next step has been to take these observations and low-level 
abstractions and formulate them in such a way that testable hypothe­
ses can readily be drawn from them. This is the point I have reached. 
I make no apology for the fact that I am reporting no empirical in­
vestigations of these formulations. If past experience is any guide, 
then I may rest assured that, if the formulations I am about to pre­
sent check in anv way with the subjective experience of other 
therapists, then a great deal of research will be stimulated, and in a 
few years there will be ample evidence of the degree of truth and 
falsity in the statements which follow.
T h e D if f ic u l t ie s an d E x c it e m e n t  o f t h e  S ea rch
It may seem strange to you that I tell you so much of the personal 
process I went through in seeking for some simple — and I am sure, 
inadequate — fonnulations. It is because I feel that nine-tenths of 
research is always submerged, and that only the iciest portion is 
ever seen, a very misleading segment. Only occasionally does some­
one like Mooney (6, 7) describe the whole of the research method 
as it exists in the individual. I too should like to reveal something of 
the whole of this study as it went on in me, not simply the imper­
sonal portion.
Indeed I wish I might share with you much more fully some of the 
excitement and discouragement of this effort to understand process. 
I would like to tell you of my fresh discovery of the way feelings 
“ hit” clients —  a word they frequently use. The client is talking 
about something of importance, when wham! he is hit by a feeling
— not something named or labelled but an experiencing of an un­
known something which has to be cautiously explored before it can 
be named at all. As one client says, “ It’s a feeling that I’m caught 
with. I can’t even know what it connects with.” The frequency of 
this event was striking to me.
Another matter of interest was the variety of ways in which 
clients do come closer to their feelings. 
Feelings “bubble up 
through,” they “seep through.” The client also lets himself “down

130
T h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
into” his feeling, often with caution and fear. “ I want to get down 
into this feeling. You can kinda see how hard it is to get really close 
to it.”
Still another of these naturalistic observations has to do with the 
importance which the client comes to attach to exactness of symbol­
ization. He wants just the precise word which for him describes the 
feeling he has experienced. An approximation will not do. And this 
is certainly for clearer communication within himself, since any one 
of several words would convey the meaning equally well to an­
other.
I came also to appreciate what I think of as “moments of move­
ment” —  moments when it appears that change actually occurs. 
These moments, with their rather obvious physiological concomi­
tants, I will try to describe later.
I would also like to mention the profound sense of despair I some­
times felt, wandering naively in the incredible complexity of the 
therapeutic relationship. Small wonder that we prefer to approach 
therapy with many rigid preconceptions. W e feel we must bring 
order to it. W e can scarcely dare to hope that we can discover 
order in it.
These are a few of the personal discoveries, puzzlements, and dis­
couragements which I encountered in working on this problem. 
Out of these came the more formal ideas which I would now like to 
present.

If we were studying the process of growth in plants, we would 
assume certain constant conditions of temperature, moisture and 
sunlight, in forming our conceptualization of the process. Likewise 
in conceptualizing the process of personality change in psycho­
therapy, I shall assume a constant and optimal set of conditions for 
facilitating this change. I have recently tried to spell out these con­
ditions in some detail ( 8). For our present purpose I believe I can 
state this assumed condition in one word. Throughout the discus­
sion which follows, I shall assume that the client experiences him­
self as being fully received. 
By this I mean that whatever his 
feelings —  fear, despair, insecurity, anger, whatever his mode of ex­
pression — silence, gestures, tears, or words; whatever he finds him­

self being in this moment, he senses that he is psychologically re­
ceived, just as he is, by the therapist. There is implied in this term 
the concept of being understood, empathically, and the conccpt of 
acceptance. It is also well to point out that it is the client’s experi­
ence of this condition which makes it optimal, not merely the fact 
of its existence in the therapist.
In all that I shall say, then, about the process of change, I shall 
assume as a constant an optimal and maximum condition of being 
received.
T h e E m e r g in g  C o n t in u u m
In trying to grasp and conceptualize the process of change, I was 
initially looking for elements which would mark or characterize 
change itself. I was thinking of change as an entity, and searching 
for its specific attributes. W hat gradually emerged in my under­
standing as I exposed myself to the raw material of change was a 
continuum of a different sort than I had conceptualized before.
Individuals move, I began to see, not from a fixity or homeostasis 
through change to a new fixity, though such a process is indeed pos­
sible. But much the more significant continuum is from fixity to 
changingness, from rigid structure to flow, from stasis to process. I 
formed the tentative hypothesis that perhaps the qualities of the 
client’s expression at any one point might indicate his position on 
this continuum, might indicate where he stood in the proccss of 
change.
I gradually developed this concept of a process, discriminating 
seven stages in it, though I would stress that it is a continuum, and 
that whether one discriminated three stages or fifty, there would 
still be all the intermediate points.
I came to feel that a given client, taken as a whole, usually ex­
hibits behaviors which cluster about a relatively narrow range on 
this continuum. That is, it is unlikely that in one area of his life the 
client would exhibit complete fixity, and in another area complete 
changingness. He would tend, as a whole, to be at some stage in 
this process. However, the process I wish to describe applies more 
exactly, I believe, to given areas of personal meanings, where I 
hypothesize that the client would, in such an area, be quite definitely 
at one stage, and would not exhibit characteristics of various stages.

Let me then try to portray the way in which I see the successive 
stages of the process by which the individual changes from fixity to 
flowingness, from a point nearer the rigid end of the continuum to 
a point nearer the “ in-motion” end of the continuum. If I am cor­
rect in my observations then it is possible that by dipping in and 
sampling the qualities of experiencing and expressing in a given 
individual, in a climate where he feels himself to be completely 
received, we may be able to determine where he is in this continuum 
of personality change.
F ir st S ta g e
The individual in this stage of fixity and remoteness of experienc­
ing is not likely to come voluntarily for therapy. However I can to 
some degree illustrate the characteristics of this stage.
There is an unwillingness to communicate self. Communication is 
only about externals.
Example: “Well, I’ll tell you, it always seems a little bit nonsensi­
cal to talk about one’s self except in times of dire necessity.” *
Feelings and personal meanings are neither recognized nor owned. 
Personal constructs (to borrow Kelly's helpful ter?n (3) ) are ex­
tremely rigid.
Close and communicative relationshipi are construed as dangerous. 
N o problems are recognized or perceived at this stage.
There is no desire to change.
Example: “I think I’m practically healthy.”
There is much blockage of internal communication.
Perhaps these brief statements and examples will convey some­
thing of the psychological fixity of this end of the continuum. The
• 
The many examples used as illustrations are taken from recorded inter­
views, unless otherwise noted. For the most part they are taken from in­
terviews which have never been published, but a number of them are taken 
from the report of two cases by Lewis, Rogers and Shlien (5).

individual has little or no recognition of the ebb and flow of the 
feeling life within him. The wavs in which he construes experience 
have been set by his past, and are rigidly unaffected by the actual­
ities of the present. He is (to use the term of Gendlin and Zimring) 
structure-bound in his manner of experiencing. That is, he reacts 
“ to the situation of now by finding it to be like a past experience and 
then reacting to that past, feeling it” ( 2). 
Differentiation of per­
sonal meanings in experience is crude or global, experience being 
seen largely in black and white terms. He does not communicate 
hirme/f, but only communicates about externals. He tends to see 
himself as having no problems, or the problems he recognizes are 
perceived as entirely external to himself. There is much blockage of 
internal communication between self and experience. The individual 
at this stage is represented by such terms as stasis, fixity, the opposite 
of flow or change.
S e c o n d  S t a g e  o f P r o c e s s
When the person in the first stage can experience himself as fully 
received then the second stage follows. W e seem to know very 
little about how to provide the experience of being received for the 
person in the first stage, but it is occasionally achieved in play or 
group therapy where the person can be exposed to a receiving cli­
mate, without himself having to take any initiative, for a long 
enough time to experience himself as received. In any event, where 
he does experience this, then a slight loosening and flowing of sym­
bolic expression occurs, which tends to be characterized by the fol­
lowing.
Expression begins to flow in regard to non-self topics.
Example: “I guess that I suspect my father has often felt very 
insecure in his business relations.”
Problems are perceived as external to self.
Example: “Disorganization keeps cropping up in my life.”
There is no sense of personal responsibility in problems.
Example: This is illustrated in the above excerpt.

134
T h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
Feelings are described as unowned, or sometimes as past objects.
Example: Counselor: “ If you want to tell me something of what 
brought you here. . . .” Client: “The symptom was — it was — 
just being very depressed.” This is an excellent example of the way 
in which internal problems can be perceived and communicated 
about as entirely external. She is not saying “ I am depressed” or 
even “ I was depressed.” Her feeling is handled as a remote, unowned 
object, entirely external to self.
Feelings may be exhibited, but are not recognized as such or owned.
Experiencing is bound by the structure of the past.
Example: “ I suppose the compensation I always make is, rather 
than trying to communicate with people or have the right relation­
ship with them, to compensate by, well, shall we say, being on an 
intellectual level.” Here the client is beginning to recognize the way 
in which her experiencing is bound by the past. Her statement also 
illustrates the remoteness of experiencing at this level. 
It is as 
though she were holding her experience at arm’s length.
Personal constructs are rigid, and unrecognized as being constructs, 
but are thought of as facts.
Example: “I can’t ever do anything right — can’t ever finish it.”
Differentiation of personal meanings and feeli?2gs is very limited and 
global.
Example: The preceding example is a good illustration. “ I can’t 
ever” is one instance of a black and white differentiation, as is also 
the use of “right” in this absolute sense.
Contradictions may be expressed, but with little recognition of them 
as contradictions.
Example: “ I want to know things, but I look at the same page 
for an hour.”
As a comment on this second stage of the process of change, it 
might be said that a number of clients who voluntarily come for 
help are in this stage, but we (and probably therapists in general) 
have a very modest degree of success in working with them. This

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
135
seems at least, to be a reasonable conclusion from Kirtner’s study (5), 
though his conceptual framework was somewhat different. W e seem 
to know too little about the ways in which a person at this stage 
may come to experience himself as “ received.”
S ta ge T h r e e
If the slight loosening and flowing in the second stage is not 
blocked, but the client feels himself in these respects to be fully re­
ceived as he is, then there is a still further loosening and flowing of 
symbolic expression. Here are some of the characteristics which 
seem to belong together at approximately this point on the con­
tinuum.
There is a freer flow of expression about the self as an object.
Example: “ I try hard to be perfect with her — cheerful, friendly, 
intelligent, talkative — because I want her to love me.”
There is also expression about self-related experiences as objects.
Example: “And yet there is the matter of, well, how much do you 
leave yourself open to marriage, and if your professional vocation is 
important, and that’s the thing that’s really yourself at this point, it 
does place a limitation on your contacts.” In this excerpt her self 
is such a remote object that this would probably best be classified as 
being between stages two and three.
There is also expression about the self as a reflected object, existing 
primarily in others.
Example: “ I can feel myself smiling sweetly the way my mother 
does, or being gruff and important the way my father does some­
times— slipping into everyone else’s personalities but mine.”
There is vmch expression about or description of feelings and per­
sonal meanings not now present.
Usually, of course, these are communications about past feelings. 
Example: There were “so many things I couldn’t tell people — 
nasty things I did. I felt so sneaky and bad.”
Example: “And this feeling that came into me was just the feeling 
that I remember as a kid.”

136
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
There is very little acceptance of feelings. For the most part feelings 
are revealed as something shameful, bady
 or abnormal, or unaccept­
able in other 'ways.
Feelings are exhibited, and then sometimes recognized as feelings. 
Experiencing is described as in the past, or as somewhat remote from 
the self.
The preceding examples illustrate this.
Personal constructs are rigid, but may be recognized as constructs, 
not external facts.
Example: “ 1
 felt guilty for so much of my young life that I expect 
I felt I deserved to be punished most of the time anyway. If I didn’t 
feel I deserved it for one thing, I felt I deserved it for another.” Ob­
viously he sees this as the way he has construed experience rather 
than as a settled fact.
Example: “I’m so much afraid wherever affection is involved it 
just means submission. And this I hate, but I seem to equate the two, 
that if I am going to get affection, then it means that I must give in 
to what the other person wants to do.”
Differentiation of feelings and meanings is slightly sharper, less 
global, than in previous stages.
Example: “I mean, I was saying it before, but this time I really 
felt it. And is it any wonder that I felt so darn lousy when this 
was the way it was, th at. . .  they did me a dirty deal plenty of times. 
And conversely, I was no angel about it; I realize that.”
There is a recognition of contradictions in experience.
Example: Client explains that on the one hand he has expectations 
of doing something great; on the other hand he feels he may easily 
end up as a bum.
Personal choices are often seen as ineffective.
The client “chooses” to do something, but finds that his behaviors 
do not fall in line with this choice.
I believe it will be evident that many people who seek psychologi­
cal help are at approximately the point of stage three. They may 
stay at roughly this point for a considerable time describing non­

present feelings and exploring the self as an object, before being 
ready to move to the next stage.
S ta ge F o ur
When the client feels understood, welcomed, received as he is in 
the various aspects of his experience at the stage three level then 
there is a gradual loosening of constructs, a freer flow of feelings 
which are characteristic of movement up the continuum. We may 
try to capture a number of the characteristics of this loosening, 
and term them the fourth phase of the process.
The client describes more intense feelings of the “ not-noiv-present” 
variety.
Example: “Well, I was really — it hit me down deep.”
Feelings are described as objects in the present.
Example: “ It discourages me to feel dependent because it means 
I’m kind of hopeless about myself.”
Occasionally feelings are expressed as in the present, sometimes 
breaking through almost against the client's wishes.
Example: A client, after discussing a dream including a bystander, 
dangerous because of having observed his “crimes,” says to the 
therapist, “Oh, all right, I don't trust you.”
There is a tendency toward experiencing feelings in the immediate 
present, and there is distrust and fear of this possibility.
Example: “I feel bound — by something or other. It must be me! 
There’s nothing else that seems to be doing it. I can’t blame it on 
anything else. There’s this knot —  somewhere inside of me. . . . 
It makes me want to get mad — and cry — and run aw ay!”
There is little open acceptance of feelings, though some acceptance 
is exhibited.
The two preceding examples indicate that the client exhibits suffi­
cient acceptance of his experience to approach some frightening 
feelings. But there is little conscious acceptance of them.
Experiencing is less bound by the structure of the past, is less re­
mote, and may occasionally occur with little postponement.

138
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
Again the two preceding examples illustrate very well this less 
tightly bound manner of experiencing.
There is a loosening of the way experience is construed. There are 
some discoveries of personal constructs; there is the definite recogni­
tion of these as constructs; and there is a beginning questioning of 
their validity.
Example: “ It amuses me. W hy? Oh, because it’s a little stupid of 
me — and I feel a little tense about it, or a little embarrassed, —  and 
a little helpless. (H is voice softens and he looks sad.) Humor has 
been my bulwark all my life; maybe it’s a little out of place in trying 
to really look at myself. A curtain to pull down . . .  I feel sort of at 
a loss right now. Where was I? W hat was I saying? I lost my grip 
on something— that I’ve been holding myself up with.” Here there 
seems illustrated the jolting, shaking consequences of questioning a 
basic construct, in this case his use of humor as a defense.
There is an increased differentiation of feelings, constructs, personal 
meanings, with some tendency toward seeking exactness of symboli­
zation.
Example: This quality is adequately illustrated in each of the ex­
amples in this stage.
There is a realization of concern about contradictions and incongm- 
ences between experience and self.
Example: “ I’m not living up to what I am. I really should be 
doing more than I am. How many hours I spent on the john in this 
position with Mother saying, ‘Don’t come out ’till you’ve done 
something.’ Produce! . . .  That happened with lots of things.”
This is both an example of concern about contradictions and a 
questioning of the way in which experience has been construed.
There are feelings of self responsibility in problems, though such 
feelings vacillate.
Though a close relationship still seems dangerous, the client risks 
himself, relating to some sviall extent on a feeling basis.
Several of the above examples illustrate this, notably the one in 
which the client says, “ Oh, all right, I don't trust you.”

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
139
There is no doubt that this stage and the following one constitute 
much of psychotherapy as we know it. These behaviors are very 
common in any form of therapy.
It may be well to remind ourselves again that a person is never 
wholly at one or another stage of the process. Listening to inter­
views and examining typescripts causes me to believe that a given 
client’s expressions in a given interview may be made up, for ex­
ample, of expressions and behaviors mostly characteristic of stage 
three, with frequent instances of rigidity characteristic of stage two 
or the greater loosening of stage four. It does not seem likely that 
one will find examples of stage six in such an interview.
The foregoing refers to the variability in the general stage of 
the process in which the client finds himself. If we limit ourselves 
to some defined area of related personal meanings in the client, then 
I would hypothesize much more regularity; that stage three would 
rarely be found before stage two; that stage four would rarely fol­
low stage two without stage three intervening. It is this kind of ten­
tative hypothesis which can, of course, be put to empirical test.
T h e F if t h  S ta g e
As we go on up the continuum we can again try to mark a point 
by calling it stage five. If the client feels himself received in his 
expressions, behaviors, and experiences at the fourth stage then this 
sets in motion still further Ioosenings, and the freedom of organismic 
flow is increased. Here I believe we can again delineate crudely the 
qualities of this phase of the process.*
Feelings are expressed freely as in the present.
Example: “ I expected kinda to get a severe rejection —  this I ex­
pect all the time . . . somehow I guess I even feel it with you. . . . 
It’s hard to talk about because I want to be the best I can possibly be 
with you.” Here feelings regarding the therapist and the client in 
relationship to the therapist, emotions often most difficult to reveal, 
are expressed openly.
• 
The further we go up the scale, the less adequate are examples given in 
print. The reason for this is that the quality of experiencing becomes more 
important at these upper levels, and this can only be suggested by a transcript, 
certainly not fully communicated. Perhaps in time a series of recorded ex­
amples can be made available.

140
T h e  P r o c e s s o f  B i-
x o m i k g  a  P e r s o n
Feelings are very close to being fully experienced. They “ bubble 
u p ” “seep through” in spite of the fear and distrust which the 
client feels at experiencing them with fullness and immediacy.
Example: “That kinda came out and I just don’t understand it. 
(Long pause) I’m trying to get hold of what that terror is.”
Example: Client is talking about an external event. Suddenly she 
gets a pained, stricken look.
Therapist: “ W hat — what’s hitting you now?”
Client: “I don’t know. (She cries) . . .  I must have been getting 
a little too close to something I didn’t want to talk about, or some­
thing.” Here the feeling has almost seeped through into awareness 
in spite of her.
Example: “ I feel stopped right now. W hy is my mind blank right 
now? I feel as if I’m hanging onto something, and I’ve been letting 
go of other things; and something in me is saying, ‘What more do I 
have to give up?’ ”
There is a beginning tendency to realize that experiencing a feeling 
involves a direct referent.
The three examples just cited illustrate this. In each case the 
client knows he has experienced something, knows he is not clear as 
to what he has experienced. But there is also the dawning realiza­
tion that the referent of these vague cognitions lies within him, in an 
organismic event against which he can check his symbolization and 
his cognitive formulations. This is often shown by expressions that 
indicate the closeness or distance he feels from this referent.
Example: “ I really don’t have my finger on it. I’m just kinda 
describing it.”
There is surprise and fright, rarely pleasure, at the feelings which 
“ bubble through”
Example: Client, talking about past home relationships, “That’s 
not important any more. Hmm. (Pause) That was somehow very 
meaningful —  but I don’t have the slightest idea why. . . . Yes, that’s 
it! I can forget about it now and — why, it isn't that important. 
W ow! All that miserableness and stuff!”
Example: Client has been expressing his hopelessness. “ I’m still

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
141
amazed at the strength of this. It seems to be so much the way I 
feel.”
There is an in creasin g ownership of self feelings, and a desire to be 
these, to be the “ real m e!'
Example: “The real truth of the matter is that I’m not the sweet, 
forebearing guy that I try to make out that I am. I get irritated at 
things. I feel like snapping at people, and I feel like being selfish at 
times; and I don’t know why I should pretend I’m not that wav.”
This is a clear instance of the greater degree of acccptance of all 
feelings.
Experiencing is loosened, no longer remote, and frequently occurs 
with little postponement.
There is little delay between the organismic event and the full 
subjective living of it. A beautifully precise account of this is given 
by a client.
Example: “ I’m still having a little trouble trying to figure out 
what this sadness — and the weepiness —  means. I just know I feel it 
when I get close to a certain kind of feeling — and usually when 
I do get weepy, it helps me to kinda break through a wall I’ve set 
up because of things that have happened. I feci hurt about some­
thing and then automatically this kind of shields things up and then I 
feel like I can’t really touch or feel anything very much . . . and 
if I’d be able to feel, or could let myself feel the instantaneous feel­
ing w hen I’m hurt. I’d immediately start being weepy right then, 
but I can’t.”
Here we see him regarding his feeling as an inner referent to 
which he can turn for greater clarity. As he senses his weepiness he 
realizes that it is a delayed and partial experiencing of being hurt. 
He also recognizes that his defenses are such that he cannot, at this 
point, experience the event of hurt when it occurs.
The ways in which experience is construed are much loosened. 
There are vtany fresh discoveries of personal constructs as con- 
structsj and a critical examination and questioning of these.
Example: A man says, “This idea of needing to please — of hav­
ing to do it — that’s really been kind of a basic assumption of my

142
T h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a  P e r s o n
life (he weeps quietly). It’s kind of, you know, just one of the 
very unquestioned axioms that I have to please. I have no choice. I 
just have to.” Here he is clear that this assumption has been a con­
struct, and it is evident that its unquestioned status is at an end.
There is a strong and evident tendency toward exactness in differen­
tiation of feelings and meanings.
Example: “ . . . some tension that grows in me, or some hopeless­
ness, or some kind of incompleteness — and my life actually is very 
incomplete right n ow .. . .  I just don’t know. Seems to be, the closest 
thing it gets to, is hopelessness.” Obviously, he is trying to capture 
the exact term which for him symbolizes his experience.
There is an increasingly clear facing of contradictions and incon­
gruences in experience.
Example: “M y conscious mind tells me I’m worthy. But some 
place inside I don’t believe it. I think I’m a rat —  a no-good. I’ve 
no faith in my ability to do anything.”
There is an increasing quality of acceptance of self-responsibility 
for the problems being faced, and a concern as to how he has con­
tributed. There are increasingly freer dialogues within the self, an 
improvement in and reduced blockage of internal communication.
Sometimes these dialogues are verbalized.
Example: “Something in me is saying, ‘W hat more do I have to 
give up? You’ve taken so much from me already.’ This is me talk­
ing to me —  the me way back in there who talks to the me who 
runs the show. It’s complaining now, saying, ‘You’re getting too 
close! G o aw ay!’ ”
Example: Frequently these dialogues are in the form of listening 
to oneself, to check cognitive formulations against the direct referent 
of experiencing. Thus a client says, “Isn’t that funny? 
I never 
really looked at it that way. I’m just trying to check it. It always 
seemed to me that the tension was much more externally caused 
than this — that it wasn’t something I used in this way. But it’s 
true — it’s really true.”
I trust that the examples I have given of this fifth phase of be-

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
143
coining a process will make several points clear. In the first place 
this phase is several hundred psychological miles from the first stage 
described. Here many aspects of the client are in flow, as against the 
rigidity of the first stage. He is very much closer to his organic 
being, which is always in process. He is much closer to being in 
the flow of his feelings. His constructions of experience are de- 
cidely loosened and repeatedly being tested against referents and 
evidence within and without. Experience is much more highly dif­
ferentiated, and thus internal communication, already flowing, can 
be much more exact.
E x a m p l e s o f P ro cess in O n e  A rea
Since I have tended to speak as though the client as a whole is at 
one stage or another, let me stress again, before going on to describe 
the next stage, that in given areas of personal meaning, the process 
may drop below the client’s general level because of experiences 
which are so sharply at variance with the concept of self. Perhaps 
I can illustrate, from a single area in the feelings of one client, some­
thing of the way the process I am describing operates in one nar­
row segment of experiencing.
In a case reported rather fully by Shlien (5) the quality of the 
self-expression in the interviews has been at approximately points 
three and four on our continuum of process. Then when she turns 
to the area of sexual problems, the process takes up at a lower level 
on the continuum.
In the sixth interview she feels that there are things it would be 
impossible to tell the therapist —  then “After long pause, mentions 
almost inaudibly, an itching sensation in the area of the rectum, for 
which a physician could find no cause.” Here a problem is viewed 
as completely external to self, the quality of experiencing is very 
remote. It would appear to be characteristic of the second stage of 
process as we have described it.
In the tenth interview, the itching has moved to her fingers. Then 
with great embarrassment, describes undressing games and other sex 
activities in childhood. Here too the quality is that of telling of non­
self activities, with feelings described as past objects, though it is 
clearly somewhat further on the continuum of process. She con-

144
T
h e  P r o c e s s  o k B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
eludes “because I’m just bad, dirty, that’s all.” Here is an expression 
about the self and an undifferentiated, rigid personal construct. The 
quality of this is that of stage three in our process, as is also the 
following statement about self, showing more differentiation of per­
sonal meanings. “ I think inside I’m oversexed, and outside not sexy 
enough to attract the response I want. . . .  I’d like to be the same 
inside and out.” This last phrase has a stage four quality in its faint 
questioning of a personal construct.
In the twelfth interview she carries this questioning further, de­
ciding she was not just born to be promiscuous. This has clearly a 
fourth stage quality, definitely challenging this deep-seated way of 
construing her experience. Also in this interview she acquires the 
courage to say to the therapist; “You’re a man, a good looking man, 
and my whole problem is men like you. It would be easier if you 
were elderly — easier, but not better, in the long run.” She is upset 
and embarrassed having said this and feels “ it’s like being naked, I’m 
so revealed to you.” Here an immediate feeling is expressed, with 
reluctance and fear to be sure, but expressed, not described. Ex­
periencing is much less remote or structure bound, and occurs with 
little postponement, but with much lack of acceptance. The sharper 
differentiation of meanings is clearly evident in the phrase “easier 
but not better.” All of this is fully characteristic of our stage four 
of process.
In the fifteenth interview she describes many past experiences and 
feelings regarding sex, these having the quality of both the third and 
fourth stage as we have presented them. At some point she says, 
“ I wanted to hurt myself, so I started going with men who would 
hurt me —  with their penises. I enjoyed it, and was being hurt, so I 
had the satisfaction of being punished for my enjoyment at the 
same time.” Here is a way of construing experience which is per­
ceived as just that, not as an external fact. It is also quite clearly 
being questioned, though this questioning is implicit. There is recog­
nition of and some concern regarding the contradictory elements in 
experiencing enjoyment, yet feeling she should be punished. These 
qualities are all fully characteristic of the fourth stage or even 
slightly beyond.
A bit later she describes her intense past feelings of shame at her

enjoyment of sex. Her two sisters, the “ neat, respected daughters” 
could not have orgasms, “so again I was the lud one.” Up to this 
point this again illustrates the fourth stage. Then suddenly she 
asks “Or am I really lucky?” In the quality of present expression 
of a feeling of puzzlement, in the “bubbling through” quality, in 
the immediate experiencing of this wonderment, in the frank and 
definite questioning of her previous personal construct, this has 
clearly the qualities of stage five, which we have just described. 
She has moved forward in this process, in a climate of acceptance, a 
very considerable distance from stage two.
I hope this example indicates the way in which an individual, in a 
given area of personal meanings, becomes more and more loosened, 
more and more in motion, in process, as she is received. Perhaps, 
too, it will illustrate what I believe to be the case, that this process 
of increased flow is not one which happens in minutes or hours, but 
in weeks, or months. It is an irregularly advancing process, some­
times retreating a bit, sometimes seeming not to advance as it 
broadens out to cover more territory, but finally proceeding in its 
further flow.
T h e S ixth  S ta g e
If I have been able to communicate some feeling for the scope 
and quality of increased loosening of feeling, experiencing and con­
struing at each stage, then we are ready to look at the next stage 
which appears, from observation, to be a very crucial one. Let me 
see if I can convey what I perceive to be its characteristic qualities.
Assuming that the client continues to be fully received in the 
therapeutic relationship then the characteristics of stage five tend to 
be followed by a very distinctive and often dramatic phase. It is 
characterized as follows.
A feeling 'which has previously been “ stuck," has been inhibited in 
its process quality, is experienced with immediacy now.
A feeling flows to its full result.
A present feeling is directly experienced with immediacy and rich­
ness.
This immediacy of experiencing, and the feeling which con­

146
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a  P e r s o n
stitutes its content, are accepted. This is something which isy
 not 
something to be denied, feared, struggled against.
All the preceding sentences attempt to describe slightly different 
facets of what is, when it occurs, a clear and definite phenomenon. 
It would take recorded examples to communicate its full quality, but 
I shall try to give an illustration without benefit of recording. A  
somewhat extended excerpt from the 80th interview with a young 
man may communicate the way in which a client comes into stage 
six.
Example: “I could even conceive of it as a possibility that I could 
have a kind of tender concern for me. . . . Still, how could 1 be 
tender, be concerned for myself, when they’re one and the same 
thing? But yet I can feel it so clearly.. . .  You know, like taking care 
of a child. You want to give it this and give it th at.. . .  I can kind of 
clearly see the purposes for somebody else . . . but I can never see 
them for . . . myself, that I could do this for me, you know. Is it 
possible that I can really want to take care of myself, and make 
that a major purpose of my life? That means I’d have to deal with 
the whole world as if I were guardian of the most cherished and 
most wanted possession, that this I was between this precious me 
that I wanted to take care of and the whole world. . . .  It’s almost as 
if I loved myself — you know — that’s strange —  but it’s true.”
Therapist: It seems such a strange concept to realize. W hy it 
would mean “I would face the world as though a part of my 
primary responsibility was taking care of this precious individual 
who is me —  whom I love.”
Client: Whom I care for — whom I feel so close to. W oof! ! 
That’s another strange one.
Therapist: It just seems weird.
Client: Yeah. It hits rather close somehow. The idea of my lov­
ing me and the taking care of me. (H is eyes grow moist.) That’s 
a very nice one — very nice.”
The recording would help to convey the fact that here is a feel­
ing which has never been able to flow in him, which is experienced 
with immediacy, in this moment. It is a feeling which flows to its 
full result, without inhibition. It is experienced acceptantly, with 
no attempt to push it to one side, or to deny it.

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
147
There is a quality of living subjectively in the experience, not feel­
ing about it.
The client, in his ivordsy
 may withdraw enough from the experi­
ence to feel about it, as in the above example, yet the recording 
makes it dear that his words are peripheral to the experiencing 
which is going on within him, and in which he is living. The best 
communication of this in his words is “ W oof! ! That’s another 
strange one.”
Self as an object tends to disappear.
The self, at this moment, is this feeling. This is a being in the 
moment, with little self-conscious awareness, but with primarily a 
reflexive awareness, as Sartre terms it. The self isf subjectively, in 
the existential moment. It is not something one perceives.
Experiencing, at this stage, takes on a real process quality.
Example: One client, a man who is approaching this stage, says 
that he has a frightened feeling about the source of a lot of secret 
thoughts in himself. He goes on; “The butterflies are the thoughts 
closest to the surface. Underneath there’s a deeper flow. I feel 
very removed from it all. The deeper flow is like a great school of 
fish moving under the surface. I see the ones that break through 
the surface of the water — sitting with my fishing line in one hand, 
with a bent pin on the end of it — trying to find a better tackle — 
or better yet, a way of diving in. That’s the scary thing. The image 
I get is that I want to be one of the fish myself.”
Therapist: “ You want to be down there flowing along, too.” 
Though this client is not yet fully experiencing in a process man­
ner, and hcnce does not fully exemplify this sixth point of the con­
tinuum, he foresees it so clearly that his description gives a real 
sense of its meaning.
Another characteristic of this stage of process is the physiological 
loosening 'which accompanies it.
Aloistness in the eyes, tears, sighs, muscular relaxation, are fre­
quently evident. Often there are other physiological concomitants. 
I would hypothesize that in these moments, had we the measure for 
it, we would discover improved circulation, improved conductivity

148
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
of nervous impulses. An example of the “primitive” nature of some 
of these sensations may be indicated in the following excerpt.
Example: The client, a young man, has expressed the wish his 
parents would die or disappear. “ It’s kind of like wanting to wish 
them away, and wishing they had never been . . . And I’m so 
ashamed of myself because then they call me, and off I go —  swish! 
They’re somehow still so strong. I don’t know. There’s some um­
bilical— I can almost feel it inside m e— swish (and he gestures, 
plucking himself away by grasping at his navel.)”
Therapist: “They really do have a hold on your umbilical cord.” 
Client: “ It’s funny how real it feels .. . It’s like a burning sensation, 
kind of, and when they say something which makes me anxious I can 
feel it right here (pointing). 1
 never thought of it quite that way.” 
Therapist: “ As though if there’s a disturbance in the relationship 
between you, then you do just feel it as though it was a strain on 
your umbilicus.”
Client: “Yeah, kind of like in my gut here. It’s so hard to define 
the feeling that I feel there.”
Here he is living subjectively in the feeling of dependence on his 
parents. Yet it would be most inaccurate to say that he is perceiv­
ing it. He is in it, experiencing it as a strain on his umbilical cord. 
In this stagey
 internal communication is free and relatively un­
blocked.
I believe this is quite adequately illustrated in the examples given. 
Indeed the phrase, “ internal communication” is no longer quite 
correct, for as each of these examples illustrates, the crucial moment 
is a moment of integration, in which communication between dif­
ferent internal foci is no longer necessary, because they become one.
The incongruence between experience and awareness is vividly ex­
perienced as it disappears into congruence.
The relevant personal construct is dissolved in this experiencing 
moment, and the client feels cut loose from his previously stabilized 
framework.
I trust these two characteristics may acquire more meaning from 
the following example. A young man has been having difficulty 
getting close to a certain unknown feeling. “That’s almost exactly

A Process Co7iception of tsycaotnerapy
149
what the feeling is, too — it was that I was living so much of my 
life, and seeing so much of my life in terms of being scared of some­
thing.” He tells how his professional activities are just to give him 
a little safety and “a little world where I’ll be secure, you know. 
And for the same reason. 
(Pause) I was kind of letting it seep 
through. But I also tied it in with you and with my relationship 
with you, and one thing I feel about it is fear of its going away. 
(His tone changes to role-play more accurately his feeling.) W on’t 
you let me have this? I kind of need it. I can be so lonely and 
scared without it.”
Therapist: “ M-hm, m-hm. ‘Let me hang on to it because I’d be 
terribly scared if I didn’t! . . . It’s a kind of pleading thing too, 
isn’t it?”
Client: “ I get a sense of — it’s this kind of pleading little boy. It’s 
this gesture of begging. (Putting his hands up as if in prayer.) 
Therapist: “ You put your hands in kind of a supplication.”
Client: “ Yeah, that’s right. ‘ Won't you do this for me?’ kind of. 
Oh, that’s terrible! Who, Me? Beg? . . . That’s an emotion I’ve 
never felt clearly at all — something I’ve never been . . . (Pause) 
. . . I’ve got such a confusing feeling. One is, it’s such a wondrous 
feeling to have these new things come out of me. It amazes me so 
much each time, and there’s that same feeling, being scared that I’ve 
so much of this. (Tears) . . .  I just don’t know myself. Here’s sud­
denly something I never realized, hadn’t any inkling of — that it 
was some thing or way I wanted to be.”
Here we see a complete experiencing of his pleadingncss, and a 
vivid recognition of the discrepancy between this experiencing and 
his concept of himself. Yet this experiencing of discrepancy exists in 
the moment of its disappearance. From now on he is a person who 
feels pleading, as well as many other feelings. As this moment dis­
solves the way he has construed himself he feels cut loose from his 
previous world — a sensation which is both wondrous and frighten­
ing.
The moment of full experiencing becomes a clear and definite ref­
erent.
The examples given should indicate that the client is often not too

150
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
clearly aware of what has “ hit him” in these moments. Yet this 
does not seem too important because the event is an entity, a refer­
ent, which can be returned to, again and again, if necessary, to dis­
cover more about it. The pleadingness, the feeling of “loving 
myself” which are present in these examples, may not prove to be 
exactly as described. They are, however, solid points of reference to 
which the client can return until he has satisfied himself as to what 
they are. It is, perhaps, that they constitute a clear-cut physiological 
event, a substratum of the conscious life, which the client can return 
to for investigatory purposes. Gendlin has called my attention to 
this significant quality of experiencing as a referent. He is endeavor­
ing to build an extension of psychological theory on this basis. ( 1)
Differe?itiatio?i of experiencing is sharp and basic.
Because each of these moments is a referent, a specific entity, it 
does not become confused with anything else. The process of sharp 
differentiation builds on it and about it.
In this stagey
 there are no longer “ problem s” external or internal. 
The client is living, subjectively, a phase of his problem. It is not an 
object.
I trust it is evident that in any of these examples, it would be 
grossly inaccurate to say that the client perceives his problem as 
internal, or is dealing with it as an internal problem. W e need some 
way of indicating that he is further than this, and of course enor­
mously far in the process sense from perceiving his problem as ex­
ternal. The best description seems to be that he neither perceives 
his problem nor deals with it. He is simply living some portion of it 
knowingly and acceptingly.
I have dwelt so long on this sixth definable point on the process 
continuum because I see it as a highly crucial one. M y observa­
tion is that these moments of immediate, full, accepted experiencing 
are in some sense almost irreversible. T o  put this in terms of the 
examples, it is my observation and hypothesis that with these clients, 
whenever a future experiencing of the same quality and characteris­
tics occurs, it will necessarily be recognizcd in awareness for what 
it is: a tender caring for self, an umbilical bond which makes him a

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
151
part of his parents, or a pleading small-boy dependence, as the case 
may be. And, it might be remarked in passing, once an experience 
is fully in awareness, fully accepted, then it can be coped with 
effectively, like any other clear reality.
T h e S e v e n t h  S ta ge
In those areas in which the sixth stage has been reached, it is no 
longer so necessary that the client be fully received by the therapist, 
though this still seems helpful. However, because of the tendency 
for the sixth stage to be irreversible, the client often seems to go on 
into the seventh and final stage without much need of the therapist’s 
help. This stage occurs as much outside of the therapeutic relation­
ship as in it, and is often reported, rather than experienced in the 
therapeutic hour. I shall try to describe some of its characterictics 
as I feel I have observed them.
New feelings are experienced with immediacy and richness of de­
tailboth in the therapeutic relationship and outside.
The experiencing of such feelings is used as a clear referent.
The client quite consciously endeavors to use these referents in 
order to know in a clearer and more differentiated way who he is, 
what he wants, and what his attitudes are. This is true even when 
the feelings are unpleasant or frightening.
There is a growing and continuing sense of acceptant ownership of 
these changing feelingsy
 a basic trust in his own process.
This trust is not primarily in the conscious processes which go on, 
but rather in the total organismic process. One client describes the 
way in which experience characteristic of the sixth stage looks to 
him, describing it in terms characteristic of the seventh stage.
“In therapy here, what has counted is sitting down and saying, 
‘this is what’s bothering me,’ and play around with it for awhile 
until something gets squeezed out through some emotional cre­
scendo, and the thing is over with — looks different. Even then, I 
can’t tell just exactly what’s happened. It’s just that I exposed some­
thing, shook it up and turned it around; and when I put it back 
it felt better. It’s a little frustrating because I’d like to know exactly 
what’s going on. . . . This is a funny thing because it feels as if I’m

152
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a  P e r s o n
not doing anything at all about it — the only active part I take is to
— to be alert and grab a thought as it’s going by . . . And there’s 
sort of a feeling, ‘W ell now, what will I do with it, now that l’ve 
seen it right?’ There’s no handles on it you can adjust or anything. 
Just talk about it awhile, and let it go. And apparently that’s all 
there is to it. Leaves me with a somewhat unsatisfied feeling though
— a feeling that I haven’t accomplished anything. It’s been accom­
plished without my knowledge or consent. . . . The point is I’m not 
sure of the quality of the readjustment because I didn’t get to see 
it, to check on it. . . . All I can do is observe the facts — that I look 
at things a little differently and am less anxious, by a long shot, 
and a lot more active. Things are looking up in general. I’m very 
happy with the way things have gone. But I feel sort of like a 
spectator.” A few moments later, following this rather grudging 
acceptance of the process going on in him, he adds, “ I seem to work 
best when my conscious mind is only concerned with facts and 
letting the analysis of them go on by itself without paying any 
attention to it.”
Experiencing has lost almost completely its structure-bound aspects 
and becomes process experiencing —  that isy
 the situation is experi­
enced and interpreted in its newness, not as the past.
The example given in stage six suggests the quality I am trying to 
describe. Another example in a very specific area is given by a 
client in a follow-up interview as he explains the different quality 
that has come about in his creative work. It used to be that he 
tried to be orderly. “You begin at the beginning and you progress 
regularly through to the end.” N ow  he is aware that the process 
in himself is different. “When I’m working on an idea, the whole 
idea develops like the latent image coming out when you develop a 
photograph. It doesn’t start at one edge and fill in over to the other. 
It comes in all over. At first all you see is the hazy outline, and 
you wonder what it’s going to be; and then gradually something fits 
here and something fits there, and pretty soon it all comes clear — 
all at once.” It is obvious that he has not only come to trust this 
process, but that he is experiencing it as it is, not in terms of some 
past.

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
153
The self becomes increasingly simply the subjective and reflexive 
awareness of experiencing. The self is much less frequently a per­
ceived object, and much more frequently something confidently 
felt in process.
An example may be taken from the same follow-up interview with 
the client quoted above. In this interview, because he is reporting his 
experience since therapy, he again becomes aware of himself as an 
object, but it is clear that this has not been the quality of his day-by- 
day experience. After reporting many changes, he says, “I hadn’t 
really thought of any of these things in connection with therapy 
until tonight. . . . (Jokingly) Gee! maybe something did happen. 
Because my life since has been different. My productivity has gone 
up. My confidence has gone up. I’ve become brash in situations I 
would have avoided before. And also, I’ve become much less brash 
in situations where I would have become very obnoxious before.” It 
is clear that only afterward does he realize what his self has been.
Personal constructs are tentatively reformulated, to be validated 
against further experience, but even then, to be held loosely.
A client describes the way in which such a construct changed, 
between interviews, toward the end of therapy.
“I don’t know what (changed), but I definitely feel different 
about looking back at my childhood, and some of the hostility 
about my mother and father has evaporated. I substituted for a 
feeling of resentment about them a sort of acceptance of the fact that 
they did a number of things that were undesirable with me. But I 
substituted a sort of feeling of interested excitement that — gee — 
now that I’m finding out what was wrong, 7 can do something about 
it — correct their mistakes.” Here the way in which he construes 
his experience with his parents has been sharply altered.
Another example may be taken from an interview with a clicnt 
who has always felt that he had to please people. “ I can sec . . . 
what it would be like — that it doesn’t matter if I don’t please you
— that pleasing you or not pleasing you is not the thing that is 
important to me. If I could just kinda say that to people — you 
know? .. . the idea of just spontaneously saying something — and it 
not mattering whether it pleases or not — Oh God! you could say

154
T h e  P r o c e s s  o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
almost anything: But that’s true, you know.” And a little later he 
asks himself, with incredulity, “ You mean if I’d really be what I 
feel like being, that that would be all right?” He is struggling to­
ward a rcconstruing of some very basic aspects of his experience.
Internal communication is clear, with feelings and symbols well 
matched, and fresh terms for new feelings.
There is the experiencing of effective choice of new ways of being.
Because all the elements of experience are available to awareness, 
choice becomes real and effective. Here a client is just coming to 
this realization. “ I’m trying to encompass a way of talking that is a 
way out of being scared of talking. Perhaps just kind of thinking 
out loud is the way to do that. But I’ve got so many thoughts I 
could only do it a little bit. But maybe I could let my talk be an 
expression of my real thoughts, instead of just trying to make the 
proper noises in each situation.” Here he is sensing the possibility of 
effective choice.
Another client comes in telling of an argument he had with his 
wife. “I wasn’t so angry with myself. I didn’t hate myself so 
much. I realized ‘I’m acting childishly’ and somehow I chose to 
do that.”
It is not easy to find examples by which to illustrate this seventh 
stage, because relatively few clients fully achieve this point. Let me 
try to summarize briefly the qualities of this end point of the con­
tinuum.
When the individual has, in his process of change, reached the 
seventh stage, we find ourselves involved in a new dimension. The 
client has now incorporated the quality of motion, of flow, of 
changingness, into every aspect of his psychological life, and this 
becomes its outstanding characteristic. 
He lives in his feelings, 
knowingly and with basic trust in them and acceptance of them. 
The ways in which he construes experience are continually chang­
ing as his personal constructs are modified by each new living event. 
His experiencing is process in nature, feeling the new in each situa­
tion and interpreting it anew, interpreting in terms of the past only 
to the extent that the now is identical with the past. He experiences 
with a quality of immediacy, knowing at the same time that he ex­

A Process Conception of Psychotherapy
155
periences. He values exactness in differentiation of his feelings and 
of the personal meanings of his experience. His internal communi­
cation between various aspects of himself is free and unblocked. 
He communicates himself freely in relationships with others, and 
these relationships are not stereotyped, but person to person. He is 
aware of himself, but not as an object. Rather it is a reflexive aware­
ness, a subjective living in himself in motion. He perceives him­
self as responsibly related to his problems. Indeed, he feels a fully 
responsible relationship to his life in all its fluid aspects. He lives 
fully in himself as a constantly changing flow of process.
S o m f. Q u e st io n s R eg arding T h is P ro cess C o n t in u u m
Let me try to anticipate certain questions which may be raised 
about the process I have tried to describe.
Is this the process by which personality changes or one of many 
kinds of change? This I do not know. Perhaps there are several 
types of process by which personality changes. 
I would only 
specify that this seems to be the process which is set in motion 
when the individual experiences himself as being fully received.
Docs it apply in all psychotherapies, or is this the process which 
occurs in one psychotherapeutic orientation only? Until we have 
more recordings of therapy from other orientations, this question 
cannot be answered. However, I would hazard a guess that perhaps 
therapeutic approaches which place great stress on the cognitive 
and little on the emotional aspects of experience may set in motion 
an entirely different process of change.
W ould everyone agree that this is a desirable process of change, 
that it moves in valued directions? I believe not. I believe some 
people do not value fluidity. This will be one of the social value 
judgments which individuals and cultures will have to make. Such 
a process of change can easily be avoided, by reducing or avoiding 
those relationships in which the individual is fully received as he is.
Is change on this continuum rapid? Aly observation is quite the 
contrary. M y interpretation of Kirtner’s study (4), which may be 
slightly different from his, is that a client might start therapy at 
about stage two and end at about stage four with both client and 
therapist being quite legitimately satisfied that substantial progress

156
T
h e  P r o c e s s o f  B e c o m in g  a P e r s o n
had been made. It would occur very rarely, if ever, that a clicnt 
who fully exemplified stage one would move to a point where he 
fully exemplified stage seven. If this did occur, it would involve a 
matter of years.
Are the descriptive items properly grouped at each stage? I feel 
sure that there are many errors in the way I have grouped my ob­
servations. 
I also wonder what important elements have been 
omitted. I wonder also if the different elements of this continuum 
might not be more parsimoniously described. All such questions, 
however, may be given an empirical answer, if the hypothesis I am 
setting forth has merit in the eyes of various research workers.
S u m m a r y
I have tried to sketch, in a crude and preliminary manner, the 
flow of a process of change which occurs when a client experiences 
himself as being received, welcomed, understood as he is. This 
process involves several threads, separable at first, becoming more 
of a unity as the process continues.
This process involves a loosening of feelings. At the lower end 
of the continuum they are described as remote, unowned, and not 
now present. They are then described as present objects with some 
sense of ownership by the individual. Next they are expressed as 
owned feelings in terms closer to their immediate experiencing. Still 
further up the scale they are experienced and expressed in the imme­
diate present with a decreasing fear of this process. Also, at this 
point, even those feelings which have been previously denied to 
awareness bubble through into awareness, are experienced, and in­
creasingly owned. At the upper end of the continuum living in the 
process of experiencing a continually changing flow of feelings 
becomes characteristic of the individual.
The process involves a change in the manner of experiencing. The 
continuum begins with a fixity in which the individual is very re­
mote from his experiencing and unable to draw upon or symbolize 
its implicit meaning. Experiencing must be safely in the past be­
fore a meaning can be drawn from it and the present is interpreted 
in terms of these past meanings. From this remoteness in relation 
to his experiencing, the individual moves toward the recognition of

A Process Covceptiofi of Psychotherapy
157
experiencing as a troubling process going on within him. Experienc­
ing gradually bccomes a more accepted inner referent to which he 
can turn for increasingly accurate meanings. Finally he becomes 
able to live freely and acceptantly in a fluid process of experiencing, 
using it comfortably as a major reference for his behavior.
The process involves a shift from incongruence to congruence. 
The continuum runs from a maximum of incongruence which is 
quite unknown to the individual through stages where there is an 
increasingly sharp recognition of the contradictions and discrepancies 
existing within himself to the experiencing of incongruence in the 
immediate present in a way which dissolves this. At the upper end 
of the continuum, there would never be more than temporary in­
congruence between experiencing and awareness since the individual 
would not need to defend himself against the threatening aspects 
of his experience.
The process involves a change in the manner in which, and the 
extent to which the individual is able and willing to communicate 
himself in a receptive climate. The continuum runs from a complete 
unwillingness to communicate self to the self as a rich and changing 
awareness of internal experiencing which is readily communicated 
when the individual desires to do so.
The process involves a loosening of the cognitive maps of ex­
perience. 
From construing experience in rigid ways which are 
perceived as external facts, the client moves toward developing 
changing, loosely held construings of meaning in experience, con­
structions which are modifiable by each new experience.
There is a change in the individual’s relationship to his problems. 
At one end of the continuum problems are unrecognized and there 
is no desire to change. Gradually there is a recognition that problems 
exist. At a further stage, there is recognition that the individual 
has contributed to these problems, that they have not arisen en­
tirely from external sources. Increasingly, there is a sense of self- 
responsibility for the problems. Further up the continuum there is 
a living or experiencing of some aspect of the problems. The person 
lives his problems subjectively, feeling responsible for the con­
tribution he has made in the development of his problems.
There is change in the individual’s manner of relating. At one end

158
T
h e  P r o c e s s  o f  B e c o m in g  a  P e r s o n
of the continuum the individual avoids close relationships, which 
are perceived as being dangerous. A t the other end of the continuum, 
he lives openly and freely in relation to the therapist and to others, 
guiding his behavior in the relationship on the basis of his immediate 
experiencing.
In general, the process moves from a point of fixity, where all the 
elements and threads described above are separately discernible 
and separately understandable, to the flowing peak moments of 
therapy in which all these threads become inseparably woven to­
gether. In the new experiencing with immediacy which occurs at 
such moments, feeling and cognition interpenetrate, self is sub­
jectively present in the experience, volition is simply the subjective 
following of a harmonious balance of organismic direction. Thus, 
as the process reaches this point the person becomes a unity of flow, 
of motion. He has changed, but what seems most significant, he 
has become an integrated process of changingness.

A Philosophy of Persons
I have form ed some philosophical impressions 
of the life and goal tow ard which 
the individual m oves when he is free.

“To Be That Self Which One Truly Is” 
A Therapist’s View of Personal Goals
I
n these days most psychologists regard it as an insult if they are 
accused of thinking philosophical thoughts. I do not share this 
reaction. I cannot help but puzzle over the meaning of what 1 
observe. Some of these meanings seem to have exciting implications 
for our modern world.
In 1951 Dr. Russell Becker, a friend, former student and colleague 
of mine, invited me to give a special lecture to an all-college con­
vocation at Wooster College in Ohio. I decided to work out more 
clearly for myself the meaning of the personal directions which 
clients seem to take in the free climate of the therapeutic relation­
ship. When the paper was finished I had grave doubts that I had 
expressed anything which was in any way new or significant. The 
rather astonishingly long-continued applause of the audience re­
lieved my fears to some degree.
As the passage of time has enabled me to look more objectively at 
what I said, I feel satisfaction on two counts. I believe it expresses 
well the observations which for me have crystallized into two im­
portant themes: my confidence in the human organism, when it is 
functioning freely; and the existential quality of satisfying living, a 
theme presented by some of our most modem philosophers, which 
163

A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
h'js however beautifully expressed more than twenty-five centuries 
ago by Lao-tzu, n'ken he said. “ The iL\iy to do is to be.”
T h e Q u e st io n s
“W hat is my goal in lifer” “W hat am I striving for?” “W hat is 
my purpose?’* These are questions which even* individual asks him­
self at one time or another, sometimes calmly and meditatively, 
sometimes in agonizing uncertainty or despair. They are old, old 
questions which have been asked and answered in every century 
of history. Yet they are also questions which every individual must 
ask and answer for himself, in his own way. They are questions 
which I, as a counselor, hear expressed in many differing ways as 
men and women in personal distress try to learn, or understand, or 
choose, the directions which their lives are taking.
In one sense there is nothing new which can be said about these 
questions. Indeed the opening phrase in the title I have chosen for 
this paper is taken from the writings of a man who wrestled with 
these questions more than a century ago. Simply to express an­
other personal opinion about this whole issue of goals and purposes 
would seem presumptuous. But as I have worked for many years 
with troubled and maladjusted individuals I believe that I can 
discern a pattern, a trend, a commonality, an orderliness, in the 
tentative answers to these questions which they have found for them­
selves. And so I would like to share with you my perception of 
what human beings appear to be striving for, when they are free to 
choose.
S o m e  A n sw e r s
Before trying to take you into this world of my own experience 
with my clients, I would like to remind you that the questions I 
have mentioned are not pseudo-questions, nor have men in the past 
or at the present time agreed on the answers. WTien men in the 
past have asked themselves the purpose of life, some have answered, 
in the words of the catechism, that “ the chief end of man is to 
glorify God.” Others have thought of life’s purpose as being the 
preparation of oneself for immortality. Others have settled on a

‘T o  Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
165
much more carthv goal — to enjoy and release and satisfy every 
sensual desire. Still others — and this applies to many today — re­
gard the purpose of life as being to achieve — to gain material pos­
sessions, status, knowledge, power. Some have made it their goal 
to give themselves completely and devotedly to a cause outside of 
themselves such as Christianity, or Communism. A Hitler has seen 
his goal as that of becoming the leader of a master race which would 
exercise power over all. In sharp contrast, many an Oriental has 
striven to eliminate all personal desires, to exercise the utmost of 
control over himself. I mention these widely ranging choices to 
indicate some of the very different aims men have lived for, to sug­
gest that there are indeed many goals possible.
In a recent important study Charles Alorris investigated ob­
jectively the pathways of life which were preferred by students in 
six different countries —  India, China, Japan, the United States, 
Canada, and Norway (5). As one might expect, he found decided 
differences in goals between these national groups. He also en­
deavored, through a factor analysis of his data, to determine the 
underlying dimensions of value which seemed to operate in the 
thousands of specific individual preferences. Without going into 
the details of his analysis, we might look at the five dimensions which 
emerged, and which, combined in various positive and negative 
ways, appeared to be responsible for the individual choices.
The first such value dimension involves a preference for a re­
sponsible, moral, self-restrained participation in life, appreciating 
and conserving what man has attained.
The second places stress upon delight in vigorous action for the 
overcoming of obstacles. It involves a confident initiation of change, 
either in resolving personal and social problems, or in overcoming 
obstacles in the natural world.
The third dimension stresses the value of a self-sufficient inner life 
with a rich and heightened self-awareness. Control over persons 
and tilings is rejected in favor of a deep and sympathetic insight into 
self and others.
The fourth underlying dimension values a receptivity to persons 
and to nature. Inspiration is seen as coining from a source outside

166
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
the self, and the person lives and develops in devoted responsive­
ness to this source.
The fifth and final dimension stresses sensuous enjoyment, self- 
enjoyment. The simple pleasures of life, an abandonment to the 
moment, a relaxed openness to life, are valued.
This is a significant study, one of the first to measure objectively 
the answers given in different cultures to the question, what is the 
purpose of my life? It has added to our knowledge of the answers 
given. It has also helped to define some of the basic dimensions in 
terms of which the choice is made. As Morris says, speaking of 
these dimensions, “it is as if persons in various cultures have in 
common five major tones in the musical scales on which they com­
pose different melodies.” (5, p. 185)
A n o t h er V ie w
I find myself, however, vaguely dissatisfied with this study. 
None of the “W ays to Live” which Morris put before the students 
as possible choices, and none of the factor dimensions, seems to con­
tain satisfactorily the goal of life which emerges in my experience 
with my clients. As I watch person after person straggle in his 
therapy hours to find a way of life for himself, there seems to be a 
general pattern emerging, which is not quite captured by any of 
Morris’ descriptions.
The best way I can state this aim of life, as I see it coming to 
light in my relationship with my clients, is to use the words of 
S0ren Kierkegaard — “ to be that self which one truly is.” (3, p. 29) 
I am quite aware that this mny sound so simple as to be absurd. T o be 
what one is seems like a statement of obvious fact rather than a goal. 
W hat does it mean? W hat does it imply? I want to devote the 
remainder of my remarks to those issues. I will simply say at the 
outset that it seems to mean and imply some strange things. Out 
of my experience with my clients, and out of my own self-search­
ing, I find myself arriving at views which would have been very 
foreign to me ten or fifteen years ago. So I trust you will look 
at these views with critical scepticism, and accept them only in so 
far as they ring true in your own experience.

uTo Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
167
D ir e c t io n s  T a k e n  b y  C l i e n t s
Let me see if I can draw out and clarify some of the trends and 
tendencies which I see as I work with clients. In my relationship 
with these individuals my aim has been to provide a climate which 
contains as much of safety, of warmth, of empathic understanding, 
as I can genuinely find in myself to give. I have not found it satisfy­
ing or helpful to intervene in the client’s experience with diagnostic 
or interpretative explanations, nor with suggestions and guidance. 
Hence the trends which I see appear to me to come from the client 
himself, rather than emanating from me.*
A w a y F r o m  F acad es
I observe first that characteristically the client shows a tendency 
to move away, hesitantly and fearfully, from a self that he is not. In 
other words even though there may be no recognition of what he 
might be moving toward, he is moving away from something. And 
of course in so doing he is beginning to define, however negatively, 
what he is.
A t first this may be expressed simply as a fear of exposing what he 
is. Thus one eighteen-year-old boy says, in an early interview: “I 
know I’m not so hot, and I’m afraid they’ll find it out. That’s why 
I do these things. . . . Th ey’re going to find out some day that I’m 
not so hot. I’m just trying to put that day off as long as possible. . . .  
If you know me as I know myself —. (Pause) I’m not going to tell 
you the person I really think I am. There’s only one place I won’t 
cooperate and that’s it. . . . It wouldn’t help your opinion of me to 
know what I think of myself.”
It will be clear that the very expression of this fear is a part of 
becoming what he is. Instead of simply being a fa5ade, as if it were 
himself, he is coming closer to being himself, namely a frightened
• 
I cannot close my mind, however, to the possibility that someone might 
be able to demonstrate that the trends I am about to describe might in some 
subtle fashion, or to some degree, have been initiated by me. I am describing 
them as occurring in the client in this safe relationship, because that seems the 
most likely explanation.

168
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
person hiding behind a facade because he regards himself as too 
awful to be seen.
A w a y F r o m  “ O u g h t s”
Another tendency of this sort seems evident in the client’s 
moving away from the compelling image of what he “ ought to be.” 
Some individuals have absorbed so deeply from their parents the 
concept “ I ought to be good,” or “I have to be good,” that it is 
only with the greatest of inward struggle that they find themselves 
moving away from this goal. Thus one young woman, describing 
her unsatisfactory relationship with her father, tells first how much 
she wanted his love. “ I think in all this feeling I’ve had about my 
father, that really I did very much want a good relationship with 
him. . . .  I wanted so much to have him care for me, and yet didn’t 
seem to get what I really wanted.” She always felt she had to meet all 
of his demands and expectations and it was “just too much. Because 
once I meet one there’s another and another and another, and I 
never really meet them. It’s sort of an endless demand.” She feels 
she has been like her mother, submissive and compliant, trying con­
tinually to meet his demands. “And really not wanting to be that 
kind of person. I find it’s not a good way to be, but yet I think I’ve 
had a sort of belief that that’s the way you have to be if you intend 
to be thought a lot of and loved. And yet who would ivant to love 
somebody who was that sort of wishy washy person?” The coun­
selor responded, “W ho really would love a door mat?” She went 
on, “At least I wouldn’t want to be loved by the kind of person 
who’d love a door m at!”
Thus, though these words convey nothing of the self she might 
be moving toward, the weariness and disdain in both her voice and 
her statement make it clear that she is moving away from a self 
which has to be good, which has to be submissive.
Curiously enough a number of individuals find that they have felt 
compelled to regard themselves as bad, and it is this concept of 
themselves that they find they are moving away from. One young 
man shows very clearly such a movement. He says: “ I don’t know 
how I got this impression that being ashamed of myself was such 
an appropriate way to feel. . . . Being ashamed of me was the way

“To Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
169
I just had to b e ... . There was a world where being ashamed of my­
self was the best way to feel. . . .  If you are something which is 
disapproved of very much, then I guess the only way you can have 
any kind of self-respect is to be ashamed of that part of you which 
isn’t approved o f .. . .
“But now I’m adamantly refusing to do things from the old view­
point. . . . It’s as if I’m convinced that someone said, ‘The way you 
will have to be is to be ashamed of yourself —  so he that w ay!’ And 
I accepted it for a long, long time, saying ‘OK, that’s m e!’ And now 
I’m standing up against that somebody, saying, ‘I don’t care what 
you say. I’m not going to feel ashamed of m yself!’ ” Obviously he 
is abandoning the concept of himself as shameful and bad.
A w a y F r o m  M e e t in g  E x pe c t a t io n s 
Other clients find themselves moving away from what the culture 
expects them to be. In our current industrial culture, for example, 
as W hyte has forcefully pointed out in his recent book (7), there 
are enormous pressures to become the characteristics which are ex­
pected of the “organization man.” Thus one should be fully a mem­
ber of the group, should subordinate his individuality to fit into the 
group needs, should become “ the well-rounded man who can handle 
well-rounded men.”
In a newly completed study of student values in this country 
Jacob summarizes his findings by saying, “The main overall effect 
of higher education upon student values is to bring about general 
acceptance of a body of standards and attitudes characteristic of 
collegebred men and women in the American community. . . . The 
impact of the college experience is . . .  to socialize the individual, 
to refine, polish, or ‘shape up’ his values so that he can fit com­
fortably into the ranks of American college alumni.” (1, p. 6)
Over against these pressures for conformity, I find that when 
clients are free to be any way they wish, they tend to resent and to 
question the tendency of the organization, the college or the culture 
to mould them to any given form. One of my clients says with 
considerable heat: “ I’ve been so long trying to live according to 
what was meaningful to other people, and what made no sense at all 
to me, really. I somehow felt so much more than that, at some level.”

170
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
So he. like others, tends to move away from being what is ex­
pected.
A w a y  F r o m  P l e a sin g  O t h fr s 
I find that many individuals have formed themselves hv trying to 
please others, bur again, when they are free, they move away from 
being this person. So one professional man, looking back at some 
of the process he has been through, writes, toward the end of 
therapy: “I finally felt that I simply had to begin doing what I 
VJ71 
ted to do. not what I thought 1
 should do, and regardless of 
what other people feel 1
 should do. This is a complete reversal of 
my whole life. I've alwa\*s felt I had to do things because they were 
cxpccted of me, or more important, to make people like me. The 
hell with it! 1
 think from now on I’m going to just be me — rich 
or poor, good or bad, rational or irrational, logical or illogical, 
famous or infamous. So thanks for your part in helping me to re­
discover Shakespeare's — ‘T o thine own self be true.’ ”
So one may say that in a somewhat negative way, clients define 
their goal, their purpose, by discovering, in the freedom and safety 
of an understanding relationship, some of the directions they do not 
wish to move. They prefer not to hide themselves and their feelings 
from themselves, or even from some significant others. They do not 
wish to be what they “ ought*’ to be, whether that imperative is set 
by parents, or by the culture, whether it is defined positively or 
negatively. They do not wish to mould themselves and their be­
havior into a form which would be merely pleasing to others. They 
do not, in other words, choose to be anything which is artificial, 
anything which is imposed, anything which is defined from with­
out. They realize that they do not value such purposes or goals, 
even though they may have lived by them all their lives up to this 
point.
T ow ard S e l f - D ir fc t io n  
But what is involved positively in the experience of these clients? 
1
 shall try to describe a number of the facets I see in the directions 
in which they move.
First of all, the client moves toward being autonomous. By this I

“To Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
171
mean that gradually he chooses the goals toward which he wants to 
move. He becomes responsible for himself. He decides w hat activi­
ties and wr
ays of behaving have meaning for him, and what do not. 
I think this tendency toward self-direction is amply illustrated in 
the examples I have given.
I would not want to give the impression that my clients move 
blithely or confidently in this direction. N o indeed. Freedom to be 
oneself is a frighteningly responsible freedom, and an individual 
moves toward it cautiously, fearfully, and with almost no confidence 
at first.
N or would I want to give the impression that he ahvays makes 
sound choices. T o  be responsibly self-directing means that one 
chooses — and then learns from the consequences. So clients find 
this a sobering but exciting kind of experience. As one client says
— “I feel frightened, and vulnerable, and cut loose from support, 
but I also feel a sort of surging up or force or strength in me.” This 
is a common kind of reaction as the client takes over the self-direc­
tion of his o w t i  life and behavior.
T o w ard B e in g  P ro cess
The second observation is difficult to make, because wr
e do not 
have good w'ords for it. Clients seem to move toward more openly 
being a process, a fluidity, a changing. They are not disturbed to 
find that they are not the same from day to day, that they do not 
always hold the same feelings toward a given experience or person, 
that they are not always consistent. They are in flux, and seem 
more content to continue in this flowing current. The striving for 
conclusions and end states seems to diminish.
One client says, “Things are sure changing, boy, when I can’t 
even predict my own behavior in here anymore. It was something 
I was able to do before. N ow  I don’t know what I’ll say next. Man, 
it’s quite a feeling. . .. I’m just surprised I even said these things. . . . 
I see something newr
 every time. It’s an adventure, that’s wfhat it is
— into the unknow n___ I’m beginning to enjoy this now, I’m joyful
about it, even about all these old negative things.” He is beginning 
to appreciate himself as a fluid process, at first in the therapy hour, 
but later he will find this true in his life. I cannot help but be re­

172
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
minded of Kierkegaard’s description of the individual who really 
exists. “ An existing individual is constantly in process of becoming, 
. . . and translates all his thinking into terms of process. It is with 
(him) . . .  as it is with a writer and his style; for he only has a style 
who never has anything finished, but ‘moves the waters of the 
language’ every time he begins, so that the most common expression 
comes into being for him with the freshness of a new birth.” (2, 
p. 79) I find this catches excellently the direction in which clients 
move, toward being a process of potentialities being born, rather 
than being or becoming some fixed goal.
T o w ard B ein g  C o m p l e x it y  
It also involves being a complexity of process. Perhaps an il­
lustration will help here. One of our counselors, who has himself 
been much helped by psychotherapy, recently came to me to discuss 
his relationship with a very difficult and disturbed client. It in­
terested me that he did not wish to discuss the clicnt, except in the 
briefest terms. Mostly he wanted to be sure that he was clearly 
aware of the complexity of his own feelings in the relationship — 
his warm feelings toward the clicnt, his occasional frustration and 
annoyance, his sympathetic regard for the client’s welfare, a degree 
of fear that the client might become psychotic, his concern as to 
what others would think if the case did not turn out well. I re­
alized that his overall attitude was that if he could be, quite openly 
and transparently, all of his complex and changing and sometimes 
contradictory feelings in the relationship, all would go well. If, 
however, he was only part of his feelings, and partly fagade or de­
fense, he was sure the relationship would not be good. I find that 
this desire to be all of oneself in each moment —  all the richness 
and complexity, with nothing hidden from oneself, and nothing 
feared in oneself — this is a common desire in those who have 
seemed to show much movement in therapy. I do not need to say 
that this is a difficult, and in its absolute sense an impossible goal. Yet 
one of the most evident trends in clients is to move toward becoming 
all of the complexity of one’s changing self in each significant 
moment.

“To Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
173
T ow ard O pf.n n f s s to F.x pk r ik n c f.
“T o be that self which one truly is” involves still other com­
ponents. One which has perhaps been implied already is that the 
individual moves toward living in an open, friendly, close relation­
ship to his own experience. This does not occur easily. Often as 
the client senses some new facet of himself, he initially rejects it. 
Only as he experiences such a hitherto denied aspect of himself in 
an acceptant climate can he tentatively accept it as a part of himself. 
As one client says with some shock after experiencing the dependent, 
small boy aspect of himself, “ That’s an emotion I’ve never felt 
clearly — one that I’ve never been!” He cannot tolerate the ex­
perience of his childish feelings. But gradually he comes to accept 
and embrace them as a part of himself, to live close to them and in 
them when they occur.
Another young man, with a very serious stuttering problem, lets 
himself be open to some of his buried feelings toward the end of his 
therapy. He says, “Boy, it was a terrible fight. I never realized it. 
I guess it was too painful to reach that height. I mean I’m just be­
ginning to feel it now. Oh, the terrible pain. . . .  It was terrible to 
talk. I mean I wanted to talk and then I didn’t want to. . . . I’m 
feeling — I think I know — it’s just plain strain — terrible strain — 
stress, that’s the word, just so much stress I’ve been feeling. I’m just 
beginning to feel it now after all these years of it. . . . it’s terrible. I 
can hardly get my breath now too, I’m just all choked up inside, all 
tight inside. . . .  I just feel like I’m crushed. {H e begins to cry.) I 
never realized that, I never knew that.” (6) Here he is opening him­
self to internal feelings which are clearly not new to him, but which 
up to this time, he has never been able fully to experience. Now  that 
he can permit himself to experience them, he will find them less ter­
rible, and he will be able to live closer to his own experiencing.
Gradually clients learn that experiencing is a friendly resource, 
not a frightening enemy. Thus I think of one client who, toward the 
close of therapy, when puzzled about an issue, would put his head 
in his hands and say, “Now  what is it I’m feeling? I want to get 
next to it. I want to learn what it is.” Then he would wait, quietly

174
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
and patiently, until he could discern the exact flavor of the feelings 
occurring in him. Often I sense that the client is trying to listen to 
himself, is trying to hear the messages and meanings which are being 
communicated by his own physiological reactions. N o longer is he 
so fearful of what he may find. He comes to realize that his own 
inner reactions and experiences, the messages of his senses and his 
viscera, are friendly. He comes to want to be close to his inner 
sources of information rather than closing them off.
Maslow, in his study of what he calls self-actualizing people, has 
noted this same characteristic. Speaking of these people, he says, 
“Their ease of penetration to reality, their closer approach to an 
animal-like or child-like acceptance and spontaneity imply a su­
perior awareness of their own impulses, their own desires, opinions, 
and subjective reactions in general.” (4, p. 210)
This greater openness to what goes on within is associated with a 
similar openness to experiences of external reality. Maslow might be 
speaking of clients I have known when he says, “self-actualized 
people have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, 
freshly and naively, the basic goods of life with awe, pleasure, won­
der, and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may be for 
other people.” (4, p. 214)
T o w ard A c c e p t a n c e o f O t h e r s 
Closely related to this openness to inner and outer experience in 
general is an openness to and an acceptance of other individuals. 
A s a client moves toward being able to accept his own experience, 
he also moves toward the acceptance of the experience of others. 
He values and appreciates both his own experience and that of 
others for what it is. T o  quote Maslow again regarding his self- 
actualizing individuals: “One does not complain about water because 
it is wet, nor about rocks because they are hard. . . .  A s the child 
looks out upon the world with wide, uncritical and innocent eyes, 
simply noting and observing what is the case, without either arguing 
the matter or demanding that it be otherwise, so does the self- 
actualizing person look upon human nature both in himself and in 
others.” (4, p. 207) 
This acceptant attitude toward that which 
exists, I find developing in clients in therapy.

“ T o Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
175
T ow ard  T r u s t o f S e lf 
Still another w ay o f describing this pattern w hich I see in each 
client is to say that increasingly he trusts and values the process 
w hich is himself. W atching m y clients, I have com e to a m uch 
better understanding o f creative people. El G reco, for example, 
m ust have realized as he looked at some of his early w ork, that “good 
artists do not paint like that.” But som ehow  he trusted his ow n 
experiencing o f life, the process o f himself, sufficiently that he could 
go on expressing his ow n unique perceptions. It was as though he 
could say, “G ood artists do not paint like this, but I paint like this.” 
Or to m ove to another field, Ernest H em ingw ay was surely aware 
that “good writers do not w rite like this.” But fortunately he m oved 
toward being H em ingw ay, being himself, rather than toward some 
one else’s conception o f a good writer. Einstein seems to have been 
unusually oblivious to the fact that good physicists did not think his 
kind o f thoughts. Rather than draw ing back because o f his inade­
quate academic preparation in physics, he sim ply m oved toward 
being Einstein, toward thinking his ow n thoughts, toward being as 
truly and deeply him self as he could. This is not a phenom enon 
w hich occurs only in the artist or the genius. Tim e and again in m y 
clients, I have seen simple people becom e significant and creative

Let me see if I can state more concisely what is involved in this 
pattern of movement which I see in clients, the elements of which 
I have been trying to describe. It seems to mean that the individual 
moves toward being, knowingly and acceptingly, the process which 
he inwardly and actually is. He moves away from being what he is 
not, from being a fa5ade. He is not trying to be more than he is, 
with the attendant feelings of insecurity or bombastic defensive­
ness. He is not trying to be less than he is, with the attendant feelings 
of guilt or self-depreciation. He is increasingly listening to the deep­

176
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
est recesses of his physiological and emotional being, and finds him­
self increasingly willing to be, with greater accuracy and depth, that 
self which he most truly is. One client, as he begins to sense the 
direction he is taking, asks himself wonderingly and with incredulity 
in one interview, “ You mean if I’d really be what I feel like being, 
that that would be all right?” His own further experience, and that 
of many another client, tends toward an affirmative answer. T o be 
what he truly is, this is the path of life which he appears to value 
most highly, when he is free to move in any direction. It is not 
simply an intellectual value choice, but seems to be the best descrip­
tion of the groping, tentative, uncertain behaviors by which he 
moves exploringly toward what he wants to be.
S o m e  M is a p p r e h e n s io n s
T o  many people, the path of life I have been endeavoring to 
describe seems like a most unsatisfactory path indeed. T o  the de­
gree that this involves a real difference in values, I simply respect it 
as a difference. But I have found that sometimes such an attitude is 
due to certain misapprehensions. In so far as I can I would like to 
clear these away.
D o es It  I m p l y  F ix it y ?
T o some it appears that to be what one is, is to remain static. They 
see such a purpose or value as synonymous with being fixed or un­
changing. Notliing could be further from the truth. T o be what 
one is, is to enter fully into being a process. Change is facilitated, 
probably maximized, when one is willing to be what he truly is. In­
deed it is the person who is denying his feelings and his reactions who 
is the person who tends to come for therapy. He has, often for years, 
been trying to change, but finds himself fixed in these behaviors 
which he dislikes. It is only as he can become more of himself, can 
be more of what he has denied in himself, that there is any prospect 
of change.

“To lie That Self Which One Truly h ”
177
Dons It I m p l y  B ein g  E v il?
An even more common reaction to the path of life I have been 
describing is that to be what one truly is would mean to be bad, evil, 
uncontrolled, destructive. It would mean to unleash some kind of a 
monster on the world. This is a view which is very well known to 
me, since I meet it in almost every client. “If I dare to let the feel­
ings flow which are dammed up within me, if by some chance I 
should live in those feelings, then this would be catastrophe.” This 
is the attitude, spoken or unspoken, of nearly every client as he moves 
into the experiencing of the unknown aspects of himself. But the 
whole course of his experience in therapy contradicts these fears. 
He finds that gradually he can be his anger, when anger is his real 
reaction, but that such accepted or transparent anger is not destruc­
tive. He finds that he can be his fear, but that knowingly to be his 
fear does not dissolve him. He finds that he can be self-pitying, and 
it is not “ bad.” He can feel and be his sexual feelings, or his “ lazy” 
feelings, or his hostile feelings, and the roof of the world does not 
fall in. The reason seems to be that the more he is able to permit 
these feelings to flow and to be in him, the more they take their 
appropriate place in a total harmony of his feelings. He discovers 
that he has other feelings with which these mingle and find a bal­
ance. He feels loving and tender and considerate and cooperative, as 
well as hostile or lustful or angry. He feels interest and zest and 
curiosity, as well as laziness or apathy. He feels courageous and 
venturesome, as well as fearful. His feelings, when he lives closely 
and acceptingly with their complexity, operate in a constructive 
harmony rather than sweeping him into some uncontrollably evil 
path.
Sometimes people express this concern by saying that if an in­
dividual were to be what he truly is, he would be releasing the beast 
in himself. I feel somewhat amused by this, because I think we might 
take a closcr look at the beasts. The lion is often a symbol of the 
“ravening beast.” But what about him? Unless he has been very 
much warped by contact with humans, he has a number of the 
qualities I have been describing. T o  be sure, he kills when he is

178
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
hungry, but he does not go on a wild rampage of killing, nor does 
he overfeed himself. He keeps his handsome figure better than some 
of us. He is helpless and dependent in his puppyhood, but he moves 
from that to independence. He does not cling to dependence. He 
is selfish and self-centered in infancy, but in adulthood he shows a 
reasonable degree of cooperativeness, and feeds, cares for, and pro­
tects his young. H e satisfies his sexual desires, but this does not 
mean that he goes on wild and lustful orgies. His various tendencies 
and urges have a harmony within him. He is, in some basic sense, 
a constructive and trustworthy member of the species felis leo. And 
what I am trying to suggest is that when one is truly and deeply a 
unique member of the human species, this is not something which 
should excite horror. It means instead that one lives fully and openly 
the complex process of being one of the most widely sensitive, re­
sponsive, and creative creatures on this planet. Fully to be one’s own 
uniqueness as a human being, is not, in my experience, a process 
which would be labeled bad. More appropriate words might be that 
it is a positive, or a constructive, or a realistic, or a trustworthy 
process.
S o c ia l  I m p l ic a t i o n s
Let me turn for a moment to some of the social implications of 
the path of life I have attempted to describe. I have presented it 
as a direction which seems to have great meaning for individuals. 
Docs it have, could it have, any meaning or significance for groups 
or organizations? W ould it be a direction which might usefully be 
chosen by a labor union, a church group, an industrial corporation, 
a university, a nation? T o  me it seems that this might be possible. 
Let us take a look, for example, at the conduct of our own country 
in its foreign affairs. By and large we find, if we listen to the state­
ments of our leaders during the past several years, and read their 
documents, that our diplomacy is always based upon high moral 
purposes; that it is always consistent with the policies we have fol­
lowed previously; that it involves no selfish desires; and that it has 
never been mistaken in its judgments and choices. I think perhaps

“To Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
179
you will agree with me that if we heard an individual speaking in 
these terms we would recognize at once that this must be a fagade, 
that such statements could not possibly represent the real process 
going on within himself.
Suppose we speculate for a moment as to how we, as a nation, 
might present ourselves in our foreign diplomacy if we were openly, 
knowingly, and acceptingly being what we truly are. I do not know 
precisely what we are, but I suspect that if we were trying to express 
ourselves as we are, then our communications with foreign countries 
would contain elements of this sort.
We as a nation are slowly realizing our enormous strength, and 
the power and responsibility which go with that strength.
We are moving, somewhat ignorantly and clumsily, toward ac­
cepting a position of responsible world leadership.
We make many mistakes. W e are often inconsistent.
We are far from perfect.
We are deeply frightened by the strength of Communism, a view 
of life different from our own.
We feel extremely competitive toward Communism, and we are 
angry and humiliated when the Russians surpass us in any field.
We have some very selfish foreign interests, such as in the oil in 
the Middle East.
On the other hand, we have no desire to hold dominion over 
peoples.
We have complex and contradictory feelings toward the freedom 
and independence and self-determination of individuals and coun­
tries: we desire these and are proud of the past support we have 
given to such tendencies, and yet we are often frightened by what 
they may mean.
W e tend to value and respect the dignity and worth of each in­
dividual, yet when we are frightened, we move away from this direc­
tion.
Suppose we presented ourselves in some such fashion, openly and 
transparently, in our foreign relations. W e would be attempting to 
be the nation which we truly are, in all our complexity and even 
contradictoriness. W hat would be the results? T o me the results 
would be similar to the experiences of a client when he is more truly

180
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f P e r s o n s
that which he is. Let us look at some of the probable outcomes.
W e would be much more comfortable, because we would have 
nothing to hide.
W e could focus on the problem at hand, rather than spending 
our energies to prove that we are moral or consistent.
W e could use all of our creative imagination in solving the prob­
lem, rather than in defending ourselves.
We could openly advance both our selfish interests, and our sym­
pathetic concern for others, and let these conflicting desires find 
the balance which is acceptable to us as a people.
W e could freely changc and grow in our leadership position, be­
cause we would not be bound by rigid concepts of what we have 
been, must be, ought to be.
We would find that we were much less feared, because others 
would be less inclined to suspect what lies behind the fa£ade.
W e would, by our own openness, tend to bring forth openness 
and realism on the part of others.
W e would tend to work out the solutions of world problems on 
the basis of the real issues involved, rather than in terms of the 
facades being worn by the negotiating parties.
In short what I am suggesting by this fantasied example is that 
nations and organizations might discover, as have individuals, that 
it is a richly rewarding experience to be what one deeply is. I am 
suggesting that this view contains the seeds of a philosophical ap­
proach to all of life, that it is more than a trend observed in the 
experience of clients.
S u m m a r y
I began this talk with the question each individual asks of himself
— what is the goal, the purpose, of my life? I have tried to tell 
you what I have learned from m y clients, who in the therapeutic 
relationship, with its freedom from threat and freedom of choice, 
exemplify in their lives a commonality of direction and goal.
I have pointed out that they tend to move away from self-conceal-

“To Be That Self Which One Truly Is”
181
nient, away from being the expectations of others. The character­
istic movement, I have said, is for the client to permit himself freely 
to be the changing, fluid, process which he is. He moves also to­
ward a friendly openness to what is going on within him — learning 
to listen sensitively to himself. This means that he is increasingly a 
harmony of complex sensings and reactions, rather than being the 
clarity and simplicity of rigidity. It means that as he moves toward 
acceptance of the “is-ness” of himself, he accepts others increasingly 
in the same listening, understanding way. He trusts and values the 
complex inner processes of himself, as they emerge toward expres­
sion. He is creatively realistic, and realistically creative. He finds 
that to be this process in himself is to maximize the rate of change 
and growth in himself. He is continually engaged in discovering 
that to be all of himself in this fluid sense is not synonymous with 
being evil or uncontrolled. It is instead to feel a growing pride in 
being a sensitive, open, realistic, inner-directed member of the hu­
man species, adapting with courage and imagination to the complexi­
ties of the changing situation. It means taking continual steps to­
ward being, in awareness and in expression, that which is congruent 
with one’s total organismic reactions. T o use Kierkegaard’s more 
aesthetically satisfying terms, it means “ to be that self which one 
truly is.” I trust I have made it evident that this is not an easy 
direction to move, nor one which is ever completed. It is a con­
tinuing way of life.
In trying to explore the limits of such a concept, I have suggested 
that this direction is not a way which is necessarily limited to clients 
in therapy, nor to individuals seeking to find a purpose in life. It 
would seem to make the same kind of sense for a group, an organiza­
tion, or a nation, and would seem to have the same kind of rewarding 
concomitants.
I recognize quite clearly that this pathway of life w'hich I have 
outlined is a value choice which is decidedly at variance wT
ith the 
goals usually chosen or behaviorally followed. Yet because it springs 
from individuals who have more than the usual freedom to choose, 
and because it seems to express a unified trend in these individuals, 
I offer it to you for your consideration.

A Therapist’s View of the Good Life: 
The Fully Functioning Person
X
A,bout 1952 or 1953 I wrote, during one of my winter escapes to 
-tA. warmer climes, a paper I entitled “ The Concept of the Fully 
Functioning Person.” It was an attempt to spell out the picture of 
the person who woidd emerge if therapy were maximally successful. 
1 was somewhat frightened by the fluid, relativistic, individualistic 
person who seemed to be the logical outcome of the processes of 
therapy. I felt two questions. Was my logic correct? If correct, was 
this the sort of person I valued? To give myself opportunity to mull 
over these ideas, I had the paper duplicated, and in the ensuing years 
have distributed hundreds of copies to interested inquirers. As I 
became more sure of the ideas it contained, I submitted it to one of 
the major psychological journals. The editor wrote that he would 
publish it, but felt that it needed to be cast in a much more conven- 
tio?ial psychological framework. He suggested many fundamental 
changes. This made me feel that it was probably not acceptable to 
psychologists in the form in which I had written it, and I dropped 
the idea of publication. Since then it has continued to be a focus of 
interest for a wide diversity of people, and Dr. Hayakawa has writ­
ten an article about the concept in the journal of the semanticists, 
ETC. Consequently this was one of the papers which came first to 
my mind when I contemplated the present book.
183

184
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
When I re-read it however 1 found that in the intervening years 
many of its most central themes and ideas had been absorbed, and 
perhaps better expressed, in other papers I have included. So, with 
some reluctance I have again put it aside, and present here instead a 
paper on my view of the good life, a paper which was based upon 
“ The Fully Functioning Person,” and which expresses, 1 believe, the 
essential aspects of that paper in briefer and viore readable form. 
My only concession to the past is to give the chapter heading a sub­
title.
M
y v ie w s regarding the meaning of the good life are largely 
based upon my experience in working with people in the 
very close and intimate relationship which is called psychotherapy. 
These views thus have an empirical or experiential foundation, as 
contrasted perhaps with a scholarly or philosophical foundation. I 
have learned what the good life seems to be by observing and partici­
pating in the struggle of disturbed and troubled people to achieve 
that life.
I should make it clear from the outset that this experience I have 
gained comes from the vantage point of a particular orientation to 
psychotherapy which has developed over the years. Quite possibly 
all psychotherapy is basically similar, but since I am less sure of that 
than I once was, I wish to make it clear that my therapeutic experi­
ence has been along the lines that seem to me most effective, the type 
of therapy termed “client-centered.”
Let me attempt to give a very brief description of what this 
therapy would be like if it were in every respect optimal, since I 
feel I have learned most about the good life from therapeutic ex­
periences in which a great deal of movement occurred. If the therapy 
were optimal, intensive as well as extensive, then it would mean that 
the therapist has been able to enter into an intensely personal and 
subjective relationship with the client —  relating not as a scientist 
to an object of study, not as a physician expecting to diagnose and
&

A Therapist's View of the G ood Life
185
curc, but as a person to a person. It would mean that the therapist 
feels this clicnt to be a person of unconditional self-worth: of value 
no matter what his condition, his behavior, or his feelings. It would 
mean that the therapist is genuine, hiding behind no defensive 
fagadc, but meeting the clicnt with the feelings which organically 
he is experiencing. It would mean that the therapist is able to let 
himself go in understanding this client; that no inner barriers keep 
him from sensing what it feels like to be the clicnt at each moment 
of the relationship; and that he can convey something of his em- 
pathic understanding to the clicnt. It means that the therapist has 
been comfortable in entering this relationship fully, without know­
ing cognitively where it will lead, satisfied with providing a climate 
which will permit the clicnt the utmost freedom to become himself.
For the client, this optimal therapy would mean an exploration 
of increasingly strange and unknown and dangerous feelings in him­
self, the exploration proving possible only because he is gradually 
realizing that he is acccptcd unconditionally. Thus he bccomcs ac­
quainted with elements of his experience which have in the past been 
denied to awareness as too threatening, too damaging to the structure 
of the self. He finds himself experiencing these feelings fully, com­
pletely, in the relationship, so that for the moment he is his fear, or 
his anger, or his tenderness, or his strength. And as he lives these 
widely varied feelings, in all their degrees of intensity, he discovers 
that he has experienced himself, that he is all these feelings. He finds 
his behavior changing in constructive fashion in accordance with his 
newly experienced self. He approaches the realization that he no 
longer needs to fear what experience may hold, but can welcome 
it freely as a part of his changing and developing self.
This is a thumbnail sketch of what client-centered therapy comes 
close to, when it is at its optimum. I give it here simply as a brief 
picture of the context in which I have formed my views of the good 
life.
A N eg a tiv e O bserv a tio n
As I have tried to live understanding^ in the experiences of my 
clients, I have gradually come to one negative conclusion about the 
good life. It seems to me that the good life is not any fixed state.

186
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f P e r s o n s
It is not, in my estimation, a state of virtue, or contentment, or 
nirvana, or happiness. It is not a condition in which the individual 
is adjusted, or fulfilled, or actualized. T o use psychological terms, 
it is not a state of drive-reduction, or tension-reduction, or homeo­
stasis.
I believe that all of these terms have been used in ways which 
imply that if one or several of these states is achieved, then the goal 
of life has been achieved. Certainly, for many people happiness, or 
adjustment, are seen as states of being which are synonymous with 
the good life. And social scientists have frequently spoken of the 
reduction of tension, or the achievement of homeostasis or equilib­
rium as if these states constituted the goal of the process of living.
So it is with a certain amount of surprise and concern that I 
realize that my experience supports none of these definitions. If I 
focus on the experience of those individuals who seem to have evi­
denced the greatest degree of movement during the therapeutic rela­
tionship, and who, in the years following this relationship, appear to 
have made and to be making real progress toward the good life, then 
it seems to me that they are not adequately described at all by any 
of these terms which refer to fixed states of being. I believe they 
would consider themselves insulted if they were described as “ad­
justed,” and they would regard it as false if they were described as 
“happy” or “ contented,” or even “ actualized.” As I have known 
them I would regard it as most inaccurate to say that all their drive 
tensions have been reduced, or that they are in a state of homeostasis. 
So I am forced to ask myself whether there is any way in which 
I can generalize about their situation, any definition which I can 
give of the good life which would seem to fit the facts as I have 
observed them. I find this not at all easy, and what follows is stated 
very tentatively.
A P o sit iv e O b ser v a tio n
If I attempt to capture in a few words what seems to me to be 
true of these people, I believe it will come out something like this:
The good life is a process, not a state of being.
It is a direction, not a destination.
The direction which constitutes the good life is that which is

A Therapist's View of the G ood Life
187
selected by the total organism, when there is psychological freedom 
to move in any direction.
This organismically selected direction seems to have certain dis­
cernible general qualities which appear to be the same in a wide 
variety of unique individuals.
So I can integrate these statements into a definition which can at 
least serve as a basis for consideration and discussion. The good life, 
from the point of view of my experience, is the process of movement 
in a direction which the human organism selects when it is inwardly 
free to move in any direction, and the general qualities of this 
selected direction appear to have a certain universality.
T h e  C h a r a c t e r is t ic s o f  t h e  P r o c e s s
Let me now try to specify what appear to be the characteristic 
qualities of this process of movement, as they crop up in person after 
person in therapy.
A n In c r e a s in g  O p e n n e ss t o  E x p e r ie n c e
In the first place, the process seems to involve an increasing 
openness to experience. This phrase has come to have more and 
more meaning for me. It is the polar opposite of defensiveness. De­
fensiveness I have described in the past as being the organism’s re­
sponse to experiences which are perceived or anticipated as threat­
ening, as incongment with the individual’s existing picture of himself, 
or of himself in relationship to the world. These threatening ex­
periences are temporarily rendered harmless by being distorted in 
awareness, or being denied to awareness. I quite literally cannot see, 
with accuracy, those experiences, feelings, reactions in myself which 
are significantly at variance with the picture of myself which I 
already possess. A large part of the process of therapy is the contin­
uing discovery by the client that he is experiencing feelings and 
attitudes which heretofore he has not been able to be aware of, which 
he has not been able to “ own” as being a part of himself.
If a person could be fully open to his experience, however, every 
stimulus — whether originating within the organism or in the en-

188
A  P h il o s o p h y  o r  P e r s o n s
vironmcnt — would be freely relayed through the nervous system 
without being distorted by any defensive mechanism. There would 
be no need of the mechanism of “subception” whereby the organism 
is forewarned of any experience threatening to the self. On the con­
trary, whether the stimulus was the impact of a configuration of 
form, color, or sound in the environment on the sensory nerves, 
or a memory trace from the past, or a visceral sensation of fear or 
pleasure or disgust, the person would be “living” it, would have it 
completely available to awareness.
Thus, one aspect of this process which I am naming “ the good 
life” appears to be a movement away from the pole of defensiveness 
toward the pole of openness to experience. The individual is be­
coming more able to listen to himself, to experience what is going on 
within himself. He is more open to his feelings of fear and discour­
agement and pain. He is also more open to his feelings of courage, 
and tenderness, and awe. He is free to live his feelings subjectively, 
as they exist in him, and also free to be aware of these feelings. He is 
more able fully to live the experiences of his organism rather than 
shutting them out of awareness.
I n c r e a sin g l y  E x is t e n t ia l L iv in g
A second characteristic of the process which for me is the good 
life, is that it involves an increasing tendency to live fully in each 
moment. This is a thought which can easily be misunderstood, and 
which is perhaps somewhat vague in my own thinking. Let me try 
to explain what I mean.
I believe it would be evident that for the person who was fully 
open to his new experience, completely without defensiveness, each 
moment would be new. The complex configuration of inner and 
outer stimuli which exists in this moment has never existed before 
in just this fashion. Consequently such a person would realize that 
“What I will be in the next moment, and what I will do, grows out 
of that moment, and cannot be predicted in advance either by me or 
by others.” N ot infrequently we find clients expressing exactly this 
sort of feeling.
One way of expressing the fluidity which is present in such ex­
istential living is to say that the self and personality emerge from

A Therapist's View of the Good Life
189
experience, rather than experience being translated or twisted to fit 
preconceived self-structure. It means that one becomes a participant 
in and an observer of the ongoing process of organismic experience, 
rather than being in control of it.
Such living in the moment means an absence of rigidity, of tight 
organization, of the imposition of structure on experience. It means 
instead a maximum of adaptability, a discovery of structure in 
experience, a flowing, changing organization of self and personality.
It is this tendency toward existential living which appears to me 
very evident in people who are involved in the process of the good 
life. One might almost say that it is the most essential quality of it. 
It involves discovering the structure of experience in the process of 
living the experience. Most of us, on the other hand, bring a pre­
formed structure and evaluation to our experience and never re­
linquish it, but cram and twist the experience to fit our preconcep­
tions, annoyed at the fluid qualities which make it so unruly in fitting 
our carefully constructed pigeonholes. T o  open one’s spirit to what 
is going on ?iow, and to discover in that present process w hatever 
structure it appears to have — this to me is one of the qualities of the 
good life, the mature life, as I see clients approach it.
A n I n c r e a sin g  T r u st in  H is O r g a n ism
Still another characteristic of the person who is living the process 
of the good life appears to be an increasing trust in his organism as 
a means of arriving at the most satisfying behavior in each existential 
situation. Again let me try to explain what I mean.
In choosing what course of action to take in any situation, many 
people rely upon guiding principles, upon a code of action laid down 
by some group or institution, upon the judgment of others (from 
wife and friends to Emily Post), or upon the way they have behaved 
in some similar past situation. Yet as I observe the clients whose ex­
periences in living have taught me so much, I find that increasingly 
such individuals arc able to trust their total organismic reaction to a 
new situation because they discover to an ever-increasing degree that 
if they are open to their experience, doing what “feels right” proves 
to be a competent and trustworthy guide to behavior which is truly 
satisfying.

190
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
As I try to understand the reason for this, I find myself following 
this line of thought. The person who is fully open to his experience 
would have access to all of the available data in the situation, on 
which to base his behavior; the social demands, his own complex and 
possibly conflicting needs, his memories of similar situations, his 
perception of the uniqueness of this situation, etc., etc. The data 
would be very complex indeed. But he could permit his total or­
ganism, his consciousness participating, to consider each stimulus, 
need, and demand, its relative intensity and importance, and out of 
this complex weighing and balancing, discover that course of action 
which would come closest to satisfying all his needs in the situation. 
An analogy which might come close to a description would be to 
compare this person to a giant electronic computing machine. Since 
he is open to his experience, all of the data from his sense impressions, 
from his memory, from previous learning, from his visceral and in­
ternal states, is fed into the machine. The machine takes all of these 
multitudinous pulls and forces which are fed in as data, and quickly 
computes the course of action which would be the most economical 
vector of need satisfaction in this existential situation. This is the 
behavior of our hypothetical person.
The defects which in most of us make this process untrustworthy 
are the inclusion of information which does not belong to this 
present situation, or the exclusion of information which does. It is 
when memories and previous learnings are fed into the computations 
as if they were this reality, and not memories and learnings, that 
erroneous behavioral answers arise. Or when certain threatening ex­
periences are inhibited from awareness, and hence are withheld from 
the computation or fed into it in distorted form, this too produces 
error. But our hypothetical person would find his organism thor­
oughly trustworthy, because all of the available data would be used, 
and it would be present in accurate rather than distorted form. 
Hence his behavior would come as close as possible to satisfying all 
his needs — for enhancement, for affiliation with others, and the 
like.
In this weighing, balancing, and computation, his organism would 
not by any means be infallible. It would always give the best pos­
sible answer for the available data, but sometimes data would be

missing. Bccause of the element of openness to experience, however, 
any errors, any following of behavior which was not satisfying, 
would be quickly corrected. The computations, as it were, would 
always be in process of being corrected, because they would be con­
tinually checked in behavior.
Perhaps you will not like my analogy of an electronic computing 
machine. Let me return to the clients I know. As they become more 
open to all of their experiences, they find it increasingly possible to 
trust their reactions. If they “ feel like” expressing anger they do so 
and find that this comes out satisfactorily, because they are equally 
alive to all of their other desires for affection, affiliation, and re­
lationship. They are surprised at their own intuitive skill in finding 
behavioral solutions to complex and troubling human relationships. 
It is only afterward that they realize how surprisingly trustworthy 
their inner reactions have been in bringing about satisfactory be­
havior.

I should like to draw together these three threads describing the 
process of the good life into a more coherent picture. It appears that 
the person who is psychologically free moves in the direction of 
becoming a more fully functioning person. He is more able to live 
fully in and with each and all of his feelings and reactions. He makes 
increasing use of all his organic equipment to sense, as accurately as 
possible, the existential situation within and without. He makes use 
of all of the information his nervous system can thus supply, using 
it in awareness, but recognizing that his total organism may be, and 
often is, wiser than his awareness. He is more able to permit his 
total organism to function freely in all its complexity in selecting, 
from the multitude of possibilities, that behavior which in this mo­
ment of time will be most generally and genuinely satisfying. He is 
able to put more trust in his organism in this functioning, not be­
cause it is infallible, but because he can be fully open to the conse­
quences of each of his actions and correct them if they prove to be 
less than satisfying.
He is more able to experience all of his feelings, and is less afraid 
of any of his feelings; he is his own sifter of evidence, and is more

192
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
open to evidence from all sources; he is completely engaged in the 
process of being and becoming himself, and thus discovers that he is 
soundly and realistically social; he lives more completely in this 
moment, but learns that this is the soundest living for all time. He is 
becoming a more fully functioning organism, and because of the 
awareness of himself which flows freely in and through his experi­
ence, he is becoming a more fully functioning person.

Any view of what constitutes the good life carries with it many 
implications, and the view I have presented is no exception. I hope 
that these implications may be food for thought. There are two 
or three of these about which I would like to comment.
A N e w  P e r sp e c t iv e on F r e e d o m  vs D e t e r m in is m
The first of these implications may not immediately be evident. 
It has to do with the age-old issue of “ free will.” Let me endeavor 
to spell out the way in which this issue now appears to me in a new 
light.
For some time I have been perplexed over the living paradox 
which exists in psychotherapy between freedom and determinism. In 
the therapeutic relationship some of the most compelling subjective 
experiences are those in which the client feels within himself the 
power of naked choice. He is free — to become himself or to hide 
behind a fagade; to move forward or to retrogress; to behave in ways 
which are destructive of self and others, or in ways which are en­
hancing; quite literally free to live or die, in both the physiological 
and psychological meaning of those terms. Yet as we enter this field 
of psychotherapy with objective research methods, we are, like any 
other scientist, committed to a complete determinism. From this 
point of view every thought, feeling, and action of the client is de­
termined by what preceded it. There can be no such thing as free­
dom. The dilemma I am trying to describe is no different than that 
found in other fields — it is simply brought to sharper focus, and 
appears more insoluble.

A Therapist's View of the G ood Life
193
This dilemma can be seen in a fresh perspective, however, when 
we consider it in terms of the definition I have given of the fully 
functioning person. W e could say that in the optimum of therapy 
the person rightfully experiences the most complete and absolute 
freedom. He wills or chooses to follow the course of action which is 
the most economical vector in relationship to all the internal and ex­
ternal stimuli, because it is that behavior which will be most deeply 
satisfying. But this is the same course of action which from another 
vantage point may be said to be determined by all the factors in the 
existential situation. Let us contrast this with the picture of the 
person who is defensively organized. He wills or chooses to follow 
a given course of action, but finds that he cannot behave in the 
fashion that he chooses. He is determined by the factors in the ex­
istential situation, but these factors include his defensiveness, his 
denial or distortion of some of the relevant data. Hence it is cer­
tain that his behavior will be less than fully satisfying. His behavior 
is determined, but he is not free to make an effective choice. The 
fully functioning person, on the other hand, not only experiences, 
but utilizes, the most absolute freedom when he spontaneously, 
freely, and voluntarily chooses and wills that which is also absolutely 
determined.
I am not so naive as to suppose that this fully resolves the issue 
between subjective and objective, between freedom and necessity. 
Nevertheless it has meaning for me that the more the person is living 
the good life, the more he will experience a freedom of choice, and 
the more his choices will be effectively implemented in his be­
havior.
C r e a t iv it y as a n E l e m e n t  o f t h e  G ood L if e
I believe it will be clear that a person who is involved in the direc­
tional process which I have termed “ the good life” is a creative per­
son. With his sensitive openness to his world, his trust of his own 
ability to form new relationships with his environment, he would 
be the type of person from whom creative products and creative 
living emerge. He would not necessarily be “adjusted” to his culture, 
and he would almost certainly not be a conformist. But at any time 
and in any culture he would live constructively, in as much harmony

194
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
with his culture as a balanced satisfaction of needs demanded. In 
some cultural situations he might in some ways be very unhappy, but 
he would continue to move toward becoming himself, and to be­
have in such a way as to provide the maximum satisfaction of his 
deepest needs.
Such a person would, I believe, be recognized by the student of 
evolution as the type most likely to adapt and survive under chang­
ing environmental conditions. He would be able creatively to make 
sound adjustments to new as well as old conditions. He would be a 
fit vanguard of human evolution.
B a sic T r u st w o r t h in e ss o f H u m a n  N a t u r e
It will be evident that another implication of the view I have been 
presenting is that the basic nature of the human being, when func­
tioning freely, is constructive and trustworthy. For me this is an 
inescapable conclusion from a quarter-century of experience in 
psychotherapy. When we are able to free the individual from de­
fensiveness, so that he is open to the wide range of his own needs, 
as well as the wide range of environmental and social demands, his 
reactions may be trusted to be positive, forward-moving, construc­
tive. W e do not need to ask who will socialize him, for one of his 
own deepest needs is for affiliation and communication with others. 
As he becomes more fully himself, he will become more realistically 
socialized. W e do not need to ask who will control his aggressive 
impulses; for as he becomes more open to all of his impulses, his 
need to be liked by others and his tendency to give affection will 
be as strong as his impulses to strike out or to seize for himself. 
He will be aggressive in situations in which aggression is realistically 
appropriate, but there will be no runaway need for aggression. His 
total behavior, in these and other areas, as he moves toward being 
open to all his experience, will be more balanced and realistic, be­
havior which is appropriate to the survival and enhancement of a 
highly social animal.
I have little sympathy with the rather prevalent concept that man 
is basically irrational, and that his impulses, if not controlled, will 
lead to destruction of others and self. Man’s behavior is exquisitely 
rational, moving with subtle and ordered complexity toward the

A Therapist's View of the Good Life
195
goals his organism is endeavoring to achieve. The tragedy for most 
of us is that our defenses keep us from being aware of this rationality, 
so that consciously we are moving in one direction, while organis- 
mically we are moving in another. But in our person who is living the 
process of the good life, there would be a decreasing number of such 
barriers, and he would be increasingly a participant in the rationality 
of his organism. The only control of impulses which would exist, or 
which would prove necessary, is the natural and internal balancing 
of one need against another, and the discovery of behaviors which 
follow the vector most closely approximating the satisfaction of all 
needs. The experience of extreme satisfaction of one need (for ag­
gression, or sex, etc.) in such a way as to do violence to the satisfac­
tion of other needs (for companionship, tender relationship, etc.) — 
an experience yen'- common in the defensively organized person — 
would be greatly decreased. He would participate in the vastly com­
plex self-regulatory activities of his organism — the psychological as 
well as physiological thermostatic controls — in such a fashion as to 
live in increasing harmony with himself and with others.
T h e G r e a te r R ic h n e s s o f L if e
One last implication 1
 should like to mention is that this process of 
living in the good life involves a wider range, a greater richness, than 
the constricted living in which most of us find ourselves. T o be a 
part of this process means that one is involved in the frequently 
frightening and frequently satisfying experience of a more sensitive 
living, with greater range, greater variety, greater richness. It seems 
to me that clients who have moved significantly in therapy live more 
intimately with their feelings of pain, but also more vividly with their 
feelings of ecstasy; that anger is more clearly felt, but so also is love; 
that fear is an experience they know more deeply, but so is courage. 
And the reason they can thus live fully in a wider range is that they 
have this underlying confidence in themselves as trustworthy instru­
ments for encountering life.
I believe it will have become evident why, for me, adjectives such 
as happy, contented, blissful, enjoyable, do not seem quite appro­
priate to any general description of this process I have called the 
good life, even though the person in this process would experience

196
A  P h il o s o p h y  o f  P e r s o n s
each one of these feelings at appropriate times. But the adjcctives 
which seem more generally fitting are adjectives such as enriching, 
cxciting, rewarding, challenging, meaningful. This proccss of the 
good life is not, I am convinced, a life for the faint-hearted. It in­
volves the stretching and growing of becoming more and more of 
one’s potentialities. It involves the courage to be. It means launching 
oneself fully into the stream of life. Yet the deeply exciting thing 
about human beings is that when the individual is inwardly free, he 
chooscs as the good life this proccss of becoming.

to 'writey
 and which has continued to be a satisfying expression 
of my views. I believe that one of the reasons I have liked it is that 
it was written solely for ?nyself. I had no thought of publishing it 
or using it for any purpose other than to clarify a growing puzzle­
ment and conflict within myself.
As I look back on it I can recognize the origin of the conflict. It 
was between the logical positivism in which I was educated, for 
which I had a deep respect, and the subjectively oriented existential 
thinking which was taking root in vie because it seemed to fit so well 
with viy therapeutic experience.
1 am not a student of existential philosophy. I first became ac­
quainted with the work of S0ren Kierkegaard and that of Martin 
Buber at the insistence of some of the theological students at Chicago 
who were taking work with me. They were sure that I would find 
the thinking of these men congenial, and in this they were largely 
correct. While there is much in Kierkegaard, for example, to which 
I respond not at all, there are, every now and then, deep insights and 
convictions which beautifully express views 1 have held but never 
been able to formulate. Though Kierkegaard lived one hundred 
years ago, I cannot help but regard him as a sensitive and highly per-

ceptive friend. I think this paper shows my indebtedness to him, 
mostly in the fact that reading his work loosened me up and made 
me more willing to trust and express my own experience.
Another helpful element in writing the paper was that I was fa? 
away from colleagues, wintering in Taxco, when I wrote the majoi 
portion of it. A year later, on the Caribbean island of Grenada, / 
completed the paper by writing the final section.
As with several of the other papers in this volume, / had it dupli­
cated for reading by my colleagues and students. After several years, 
at the suggestion of others, I submitted it for publication and it was 
accepted, rather to my surprise, by the American Psychologist. I 
have included it here because it seems to express, better than anything 
else I have written, the context in which I see research, and makes 
clear the reason for my “ double life” of subjectivity and objectivity.

self, to clarify an issue which has become increasingly puzzling. 
It will be of interest to others only to the extent that the issue exists 
for them. I shall therefore describe in this introduction, something 
of the way in which the paper grew.
As I have acquired experience as a therapist, carrying on the ex­
citing, rewarding experience of psychotherapy, and as I have worked 
as a scientific investigator to ferret out some of the truth about ther­
apy, I have become increasingly conscious of the gap between these 
two roles. The better therapist I have bccomc (as I believe I have) 
the more I have been vaguely aware of my complete subjectivity 
when I am at my best in this function. And as I have become a 
better investigator, more “ hard-headed” and more scientific (as I 
believe I have) I have felt an increasing discomfort at the distance 
between the rigorous objectivity of myself as scientist and the al­
most mystical subjectivity of myself as therapist. This paper is the 
result.

Persons or Science?
201
What I did first was to let myself go as therapist, and describe, as 
well as I could do in a brief space, what is the essential nature of 
psychotherapy as I have lived it with many clients. I would stress 
the fact that this is a very fluid and personal formulation, and that if 
it were written by another person, or it were written by me two 
years ago, or two years hence, it would be different in some respects. 
Then I let myself go as scientist — as tough-minded fact-findcr in 
this psychological realm, and endeavored to picture the meaning 
which science can give to therapy. Following this I carried on the 
debate which existed in me, raising the questions which each point 
of view legitimately asks the other.
When I had carried my efforts this far I found that I had only 
sharpened the conflict. The two points of view seemed more than 
ever irreconcilable. I discussed the material with a seminar of faculty 
and students, and found their comments very helpful. During the 
following year I continued to mull over the problem until I began 
to feel an integration of the two views arising in me. More than a 
year after the first sections were written I tried to express this tenta­
tive and perhaps temporary integration in words.
Thus the reader who cares to follow my struggles in this matter 
will find that it has quite unconsciously assumed a dramatic form — 
all of the dramatis personae being contained within myself; First 
Protagonist, Second Protagonist, The Conflict, and finally, The 
Resolution. W ithout more ado let me introduce the first protagonist, 
myself as therapist, portraying as well as I can, what the experience 
of therapy seems to be.
T h e  E s s e n c e  o f T h e r a p y  in  T e r m s  o f it s  E x p e r ie n c e
I launch myself into the relationship having a hypothesis, or a faith, 
that my liking, my confidence, and my understanding of the other 
person’s inner world, will lead to a significant process of becoming. 
I enter the relationship not as a scientist, not as a physician who can 
accurately diagnose and cure, but as a person, entering into a per­
sonal relationship. Insofar as I see him only as an object, the client 
will tend to become only an object.
I risk myself, because if, as the relationship deepens, what develops

202
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
is a failure, a regression, a repudiation of me and the relationship by 
the client, then I sense that I will lose myself, or a part of myself. 
At times this risk is very real, and is very keenly experienced.
I let myself go into the immediacy of the relationship where it is 
my total organism which takes over and is sensitive to the relation­
ship, not simply my consciousness. I am not consciously responding 
in a planful or analytic way, but simply react in an unreflective way 
to the other individual, my reaction being based, (but not con­
sciously) on my total organismic sensitivity to this other person. 
I live the relationship on this basis.
The essence of some of the deepest parts of therapy seems to be 
a unity of experiencing. The client is freely able to experience his 
feeling in its complete intensity, as a “ pure culture,” without intel­
lectual inhibitions or cautions, without having it bounded by knowl­
edge of contradictory feelings; and I am able with equal freedom to 
experience my understanding of this feeling, without any conscious 
thought about it, without any apprehension or concern as to where 
this will lead, without any type of diagnostic or analytic thinking, 
without any cognitive or emotional barriers to a complete “letting 
go” in understanding. When there is this complete unity, singleness, 
fullness of experiencing in the relationship, then it acquires the “out- 
of-this-world” quality which many therapists have remarked upon, 
a sort of trance-like feeling in the relationship from which both the 
client and I emerge at the end of the hour, as if from a deep well 
or tunnel. In these moments there is, to borrow Buber’s phrase, a 
real “ I-Thou” relationship, a timeless living in the experience which 
is between the client and me. It is at the opposite pole from seeing 
the client, or myself, as an object. It is the height of personal sub­
jectivity.
I am often aware of the fact that I do not know, cognitively, where 
this immediate relationship is leading. It is as though both I and the 
client, often fearfully, let ourselves slip into the stream of becoming, 
a stream or process which carries us along. It is the fact that the 
therapist has let himself float in this stream of experience or life 
previously, and found it rewarding, that makes him each time less 
fearful of taking the plunge. It is my confidence that makes it easier 
for the client to embark also, a little bit at a time. It often seems

Pet sons or Science?
203
as though this stream of experiencing leads to some goal. Probably 
the truer statement however, is that its rewarding character lies 
within the process itself, and that its major reward is that it enables 
both the client and me, later, independently, to let ourselves go in 
the process of becoming.
As to the client, as therapy proceeds, he finds that he is daring to 
become himself, in spite of all the dread consequences which he is 
sure will befall him if he permits himself to become himself. What 
docs this becoming one’s self mean? It appears to mean less fear of 
the organismic, non-reflective reactions which one has, a gradual 
growth of trust in and even affection for the complex, varied, rich 
assortment of feelings and tendencies which exist in one at the or­
ganic or organismic level. 
Consciousness, instead of being the 
watchman over a dangerous and unpredictable lot of impulses, of 
which few can be permitted to sec the light of day, becomes the 
comfortable inhabitant of a richly varied society of impulses and 
feelings and thoughts, which prove to be very satisfactorily self- 
governing when not fearfully or authoritatively guarded.
Involved in this process of becoming himself is a profound experi­
ence of personal choice. He realizes that he can choose to continue 
to hide behind a fagade, or that he can take the risks involved in 
being himself; that he is a free agent who has it within his power to 
destroy another, or himself, and also the power to enhance himself 
and others. Faced with this naked reality of decision, he chooses 
to move in the direction of being himself.
But being himself doesn’t “solve problems.” It simply opens up a 
new way of living in which there is more depth and more height in 
the experience of his feelings; more breadth and more range. He 
feels more unique and hence more alone, but he is so much more real 
that his relationships with others lose their artificial quality, become 
deeper, more satisfying, and draw more of the realness of the other 
person into the relationship.
Another way of looking at this process, this relationship, is that 
it is a learning by the client (and by the therapist, to a lesser extent). 
But it is a strange type of learning. Almost never is the learning 
notable by its complexity, and at its deepest the learnings never seem 
to fit well into verbal symbols. Often the learnings take such simple

204
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
forms as “ I am different from others” ; “I do feci hatred for him” ; 
“ I am fearful of feeling dependent” ; “ I do feel sorry for myself” ; 
“ I am self-centered” ; “ I do have tender and loving feelings” ; “1
 could 
be what 1
 want to be” ; etc. But in spite of their seeming simplicity 
these learnings are vastly significant in some new way which is very 
difficult to define. W e can think of it in various ways. They are 
self-appropriated learnings, for one thing, based somehow in experi­
ence, not in symbols. They arc analogous to the learning of the child 
who knows that “two and two make four” and who one day playing 
with two objccts and two objects, suddenly realizes in experience a 
totally new learning, that “two and two do make four.”
Another manner of understanding these learnings is that they are 
a belated attempt to match symbols with meanings in the world of 
feelings, an undertaking long since achieved in the cognitive realm. 
Intellectually, we match carefully the symbol we select with the 
meaning which an experience has for us. Thus I say something hap­
pened “ gradually,” having quickly (and largely unconsciously) re­
viewed such terms as “slowly,” “ imperceptibly,” “step-by-step,” 
etc., and rejected them as not carrying the precise shade of meaning 
of the experience. But in the realm of feelings, we have never learned 
to attach symbols to experience with any accuracy of meaning. This 
something which I feel welling up in myself, in the safety of an 
acccptant relationship — what is it? Is it sadness, is it anger, is it 
regret, is it sorrow for myself, is it anger at lost opportunities — I 
stumble around trying out a wide range of symbols, until one “ fits,” 
“feels right,” seems really to match the organismic experience. In 
doing this type of thing the client discovers that he has to learn the 
language of feeling and emotion as if he were an infant learning to 
speak; often even worse, he finds he must unlearn a false language 
before learning the true one.
Let us try still one more way of defining this type of learning, 
this time by describing what it is not. It is a type of learning which 
cannot be taught. The essence of it is the aspect of self-discovery. 
With “ knowledge” as we are accustomed to think of it, one person 
can teach it to another, providing each has adequate motivation and 
ability. But in the significant learning which takes place in therapy, 
one person cannot teach another. The teaching would destroy the

Persons or Science?
205
learning. Thus I might teach a client that it is safe for him to be 
himself, that freely to realize his feelings is not dangerous, etc. The 
more he learned this, the less he would have learned it in the signif­
icant, experiential, self-appropriating way. Kierkegaard regards this 
latter type of learning as true subjectivity, and makes the valid point 
that there can be no direct communication of it, or even about it. 
The most that one person can do to further it in another, is to create 
certain conditions which make this type of learning possible. It can­
not be compelled.
A final way of trying to describe this learning is that the client 
gradually learns to symbolize a total and unified state, in which the 
state of the organism, in experience, feeling, and cognition may all 
be described in one unified way. T o make the matter even more 
vague and unsatisfactory, it seems quite unnecessary that this sym­
bolization should be expressed. It usually does occur, because the 
client wishes to communicate at least a portion of himself to the 
therapist, but it is probably not essential. The only necessary aspect 
is the inward realization of the total, unified, immediate, “at-this-in- 
stant,” state of the organism which is me. For example, to realize 
fully that at this moment the oneness in me is simply that “I am 
deeply frightened at the possibility of becoming something different” 
is of the essence of therapy. The client who realizes this will be 
quite certain to recognize and realize this state of his being when 
it recurs in somewhat similar form. He will also, in all probability, 
recognize and realize more fully some of the other existential feel­
ings which occur in him. Thus he will be moving toward a state in 
which he is more truly himself. He will be, in more unified fashion, 
what he organismically is, and this seems to be the essence of therapy.
T h e  E s s e n c e  o f T h e r a p y  in  T e r m s  o f  S c ie n c e
I shall now let the second protagonist, myself as scientist, take over 
and give his view of this same field.
In approaching the complex phenomena of therapy with the logic 
and methods of science, the aim is to work toward an understanding 
of the phenomena. In science this means an objective knowledge of

206
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
events and of functional relationships between events. Science may 
also give the possibility of increased prediction of and control over 
these events, but this is not a necessary outcome of scientific en­
deavor. If the scientific aim were fully achieved in this realm, we 
would presumably know that, in therapy, certain elements were 
associated with certain types of outcomes. Knowing this it is likely 
that we would be able to predict that a particular instance of a 
therapeutic relationship would have a certain outcome (within 
certain probability limits) because it involved certain elements. We 
could then very likely control outcomes of therapy by our manipula­
tion of the elements contained in the therapeutic relationship.
It should be clear that no matter how profound our scientific in­
vestigation, we could never by means of it discover any absolute 
truth, but could only describe relationships which had an increas­
ingly high probability of occurrence. N or could we ever discover 
any underlying reality in regard to persons, relationships or the uni­
verse. W e could only describe relationships between observable 
events. If science in this field followed the course of science in other 
fields, the working models of reality which would emerge (in the 
course of theory building) would be increasingly removed from 
the reality perceived by the senses. The scientific description of 
therapy and therapeutic relationships would become increasingly 
unlike these phenomena as they are experienced.
It is evident at the outset that since therapy is a complex phenome­
non, measurement will be difficult. Nevertheless “anything that 
exists can be measured,” and since therapy is judged to be a signif­
icant relationship, with implications extending far beyond itself, the 
difficulties may prove to be worth surmounting in order, to discover 
laws of personality and interpersonal relationships.
Since, in client-centered therapy, there already exists a crude 
theory (though not a theory in the strictly scientific sense) we 
have a starting point for the selection of hypotheses. For purposes of 
this discussion, let us take some of the crude hypotheses which can 
be drawn from this theory, and see what a scientific approach will 
do with them. W e will, for the time being, omit the translation of 
the total theory into a formal logic which would be acceptable and 
consider only a few of the hypotheses.

Persons or Science?
20?
Let us first state three of these in their crude form.
1. Acceptance of the client by the therapist leads to an increased 
acceptance of self by the client.
2. The more the therapist perceives the client as a person rather 
than as an object, the more the clicnt will come to perceive himself 
as a person rather than an object.
3. In the course of therapy an experiential and effective type of 
learning about self takes place in the client.
How would we go about translating each of these* into opera­
tional terms and how would we test the hypotheses? W hat would 
be the general outcomes of such testing?
This paper is not the place for a detailed answer to these ques­
tions, but research already carried on supplies the answers in a gen­
eral way. In the case of the first hypothesis, certain devices for 
measuring acceptance would be selected or devised. These might 
be attitude tests, objective or projective, Q technique or the like. 
Presumably the same instruments, with slightly different instructions 
or mind set, could be used to measure the therapist’s acceptance of 
the client, and the client’s acceptance of self. Operationally then, 
the degree of therapist acceptance would be equated to a certain 
score on this instrument. W hether client self-acceptance changed 
during therapy would be indicated by pre- and post-measurements. 
The relationship of any change to therapy would be determined 
bv comparison of changes in therapy to changes during a control 
period or in a control group. W e would finally be able to say 
whether a relationship existed between therapist acceptance and 
client self-acceptance, as operationally defined, and the correlation 
between the two.
The second and third hypotheses involve real difficulty in meas-
• 
It may be surprising to some to find hypotheses regarding such subjective 
experience treated as matters for an objective science. Yet the best thinking 
in psychology has gone far beyond a primitive behaviorism, and has recog­
nized that the objectivity of psychology as science rests upon its method, 
not upon its content. Thus the most subjective feelings, apprehensions, ten­
sions, satisfactions, or reactions, may be dealt with scientifically, providing only 
that they may be given clearcut operational definition. Stephenson, among 
others, presents this point of view forcefully (in his Postulates of Behaviorism) 
and through his Q Technique, has contributed importantly to the oojcctifica- 
tion of such subjective materials for scientific study.

uremcnt, but there is no reason to suppose that they could not be 
objectively studied, as our sophistication in psychological measure­
ment increases. Some type of attitude test or Q-sort might be the 
instrument for the second hypothesis, measuring the attitude of 
therapist toward client, and of clicnt toward self. In this case the 
continuum would be from objective regard of an external object to 
a personal and subjective experiencing. The instrumentation for 
hypothesis three might be physiological, since it seems likely that 
experiential learning has physiologically measurable concomitants. 
Another possibility would be to infer experiential learning from 
its effectiveness, and thus measure the effectiveness of learning in 
different areas. At the present stage of our methodology hypothesis 
three might be beyond us, but certainly within the foreseeable future, 
it too could be given operational definition and tested.
T he findings from these studies w ould be o f this order. Let us 
becom e suppositious, in order to illustrate more concretely. Suppose 
ur
e find that therapist acceptance leads to clicnt self-acceptance, and 
that the correlation is in the neighborhood of .70 betw een the tw o 
variables. In hypothesis tw o w e m ight find the hypothesis unsup­
ported, but find that the more the therapist regarded the client as a 
person, the m ore the client’s self-acceptance increased. Thus w e 
w ould have learned that person-centeredncss is an element of ac­
ceptance, but that it has little to do w ith the client becom ing more 
of a person to himself. Let us also suppose hypothesis three upheld 
w ith experiential learning o f ccrtain dcscribable sorts taking place 
much more in therapy than in the control subjects.
Glossing over all the qualifications and ramifications which would 
be present in the findings, and omitting reference to the unexpected 
leads into personality dynamics which would crop up (since these 
are hard to imagine in advance) the preceding paragraph gives us 
some notion of what science can offer in this field. It can give us a 
more and more exact description of the events of therapy and the 
changes which take place. It can begin to formulate some tentative 
laws of the dynamics of human relationships. It can offer public 
and replicable statements, that if certain operationally definable con­
ditions exist in the therapist or in the relationship, then certain clicnt 
behaviors may be expected with a known degree of probability. It

can presumably do this for the field of therapy and personality 
change as it is in the process of doing for such fields as perception 
and learning. Eventually theoretical formulations should draw to­
gether these different areas, enunciating the laws which appear to 
govern alteration in human behavior, whether in the situations we 
classify as perception, those we classify as learning, or the more 
global and molar changes which occur in therapy, involving both 
perception and learning.
S o m e  I s s u e s
Here are two very different methods of perceiving the essential 
aspects of psychotherapy, two very different approaches to forging 
ahead into new territory in this field. As presented here, and as they 
frequently exist, there seems almost no common meeting ground 
between the two descriptions. Each represents a vigorous way of 
seeing therapy. Each seems to be an avenue to the significant truths 
of therapy. When each of these views are held by different individ­
uals or groups, they constitute a basis of sharp disagreement. When 
each of these approaches seems true to one individual, like myself, 
then he feels himself conflicted by these two views. Though they 
may superficially be reconciled, or regarded as complementary to 
each other, they seem to me to be basically antagonistic in many 
ways. I should like to raise certain issues which these two viewpoints 
pose for me.
T h e S c ie n t is t ’s Q u e st io n s
First let me pose some of the questions which the scientific view­
point asks of the experiential (using scientific and experiential simply 
as loose labels to indicate the two views). The hard-headed scientist 
listens to the experiential account, and raises several searching ques­
tions.
1. 
First of all he wants to know, “ How can you know that this 
account, or any account given at a previous or later time, is true? 
How do you know that it has any relationship to reality? If we are 
to rely on this inner and subjective experience as being the truth

210
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
about human relationships or about ways of altering personality, 
then Yogi, Christian Scicnce, dianetics, and the delusions of a psy­
chotic individual who believes himself to be Jesus Christ, are all true, 
just as true as this account. Each of them represents the truth as 
perceived inwardly by some individual or group of individuals. 
If we are to avoid this morass of multiple and contradictory truths, 
we must fall back on the only method we know for achieving an 
evcr-closer approximation to reality, the scientific method.”
2. “In the second place, this experiential approach shuts one off 
from improving his therapeutic skill, or discovering the less than 
satisfactory elements in the relationship. Unless one regards the 
present description as a perfect one, which is unlikely, or the present 
level of experience in the therapeutic relationship as being the most 
effective possible, which is equally unlikely, then there are unknown 
flaws, imperfections, blind spots, in the account as given. How are 
these to be discovered and corrected? The experiential approach can 
offer nothing but a trial and error process for achieving this, a proc­
ess which is slow and which offers no real guarantee of achieving this 
goal. Even the criticisms or suggestions of others are of little help, 
since they do not arise from within the experience and hence do not 
have the vital authority of the relationship itself. But the scientific 
method, and the procedures of a modern logical positivism, have 
much to offer here. Any experience which can be described at all 
can be described in operational terms. Hypotheses can be formu­
lated and put to test, and the sheep of truth can thus be separated 
from the goats of error. This seems the only sure road to improve­
ment, self-correction, growth in knowledge.”
3. The scientist has another comment to make. “ Implicit in your 
description of the therapeutic experience seems to be the notion that 
there are elements in it which cannot be predicted — that there is 
some type of spontaneity or (excuse the term) free will operative 
here. You speak as though some of the client’s behavior — and per­
haps some of the therapist’s — is not caused, is not a link in a se­
quence of cause and effect. W ithout desiring to become metaphysi­
cal, may I raise the question as to whether this is defeatism? Since 
surely we can discover what causes much of behavior — you your­
self speak of creating the conditions where certain behavioral re­

Versons or Science?
211
suits follow — then why give up at any point? W hy not at least 
aim toward uncovering the causes of all behavior? This does not 
mean that the individual mui>t regard himself as an automaton, but 
in our search for the facts we shall not be hampered by a belief that 
some doors are closed to us.”
4. 
Finally, the scientist cannot understand why the therapist, the 
experientialist, should challenge the one tool and method which is 
responsible for almost all the advances which we value. “In the cur­
ing of disease, in the prevention of infant mortality, in the growing 
of larger crops, in the preservation of food, in the manufacture of 
all the things that make life comfortable, from books to nylon, in 
the understanding of the universe, what is the foundation stone? It 
is the method of science, applied to each of these, and to many other 
problems. It is true that it has improved methods of warfare, too, 
serving man’s destructive as well as his constructive purposes, but 
even here the potentiality for social usefulness is very great. So why 
should we doubt this same approach in the social science field? To 
be sure advances here have been slow, and no law as fundamental as 
the law of gravity has as yet been demonstrated, but are we to give 
up this approach out of impatience? What possible alternative offers 
equal hope? If we are agreed that the social problems of the world 
are very pressing indeed, if psychotherapy offers a window into 
the most crucial and significant dynamics of change in human be­
havior, then surely the course of action is to apply to psychotherapy 
the most rigorous canons of scientific method, on as broad a scale 
as possible, in order that we may most rapidly approach a tentative 
knowledge of the laws of individual behavior and of attitudinal 
change.”
T h e Q u e st io n s o f t h e  E x p e r ie n t ia l is t 
While the scientist’s questions may seem to some to settle the 
matter, his comments are far from being entirely satisfying to the 
therapist who has lived the experience of therapy. Such an individ­
ual has several points to make in regard to the scientific view.
1. 
“ In the first place,” this “ experientialist” points out, “science 
always has to do with the other, the object. Various logicians of 
science, including Stevens, the psychologist, show that it is a basic

212
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
element of science that it always has to do with the observable ob­
ject, the observable other. This is true, even if the scientist is ex­
perimenting on himself, for to that degree he treats himself as the 
observable other. It never has anything to do with the experiencing 
me. N ow  does not this quality of science mean that it must forever 
be irrelevant to an experience such as therapy, which is intensely 
personal, highly subjective in its inwardness, and dependent entirely 
on the relationship of two individuals each of whom is an experienc­
ing me? Science can of course study the events which occur, but 
always in a way which is irrelevant to what is occurring. An analogy 
would be to say that science can conduct an autopsy of the dead 
events of therapy, but by its very nature it can never enter into the 
living physiology of therapy. It is for this reason that therapists 
recognize — usually intuitively — that any advance in therapy, any 
fresh knowledge of it, any significant new hypotheses in regard to 
it — must come from the experience of the therapists and clients, 
and can never come from science. Again to use an analogy. Cer­
tain heavenly bodies were discovered solely from examination of 
the scientific measurements of the courses of the stars. Then the 
astronomers searched for these hypothesized bodies and found them. 
It seems decidedly unlikely that there will ever be a similar outcome 
in therapy, since science has nothing to say about the internal per­
sonal experience which T  have in therapy. It can only speak of 
the events which occur in ‘him.’ ”
2. 
“Because science has as its field the ‘other,’ the ‘object,* it means 
that everything it touches is transformed into an object. This has 
never presented a problem in the physical sciences. In the biological 
sciences it has caused certain difficulties. A number of medical men 
feel some concern as to whether the increasing tendency to view the 
human organism as an object, in spite of its scientific efficacy, may 
not be unfortunate for the patient. They would prefer to see him 
again regarded as a person. It is in the social sciences, however, that 
this becomes a genuinely serious issue. It means that the people 
studied by the social scientist are always objects. In therapy, both 
client and therapist become objects for dissection, but not persons 
with whom one enters a living relationship. At first glance, this 
may not seem important. W e may say that only in his role as scien­

Persons or Science?
213
tist does the individual regard others as objects. He can also step 
out of this role and become a person. But if we look a little further 
we will see that this is a superficial answer. If we project ourselves 
into the future, and suppose that we had the answers to most of the 
questions which psychology investigates today, what then? Then 
we would find ourselves increasingly impelled to treat all others, and 
even ourselves, as objects. The knowledge of all human relationships 
would be so great that we would know it rather than live the rela­
tionships unreflectively. We see some foretaste of this in the attitude 
of sophisticated parents who know that affection ‘is good for the 
child.’ This knowledge frequently stands in the way of their being 
themselves, freely, unreflectivclv —  affectionate or not. Thus the 
development of science in a field like therapy is either irrelevant to 
the experience, or may actually make it more difficult to live the 
relationship as a personal, experiential event.”
3. 
The experientialist has a further concern. “When science trans­
forms people into objects, as mentioned above, it has another effect. 
The end result of scicnce is to lead toward manipulation. This is less 
true in fields like astronomy, but in the physical and social sciences, 
the knowledge of the events and their relationships lead to manipula­
tion of some of the elements of the equation. This is unquestionably 
true in psychology, and would be true in therapy. If we know all 
about how learning takes place, we use that knowledge to manipulate 
persons as objects. This statement places no value judgment on 
manipulation. It may be done in highly cthical fashion. W c may 
even manipulate ourselves as objects, using such knowledge. Thus, 
knowing that learning takes place more rapidly with repeated re­
view rather than long periods of concentration on one lesson, I may 
use this knowledge to manipulate my learning in Spanish. But knowl­
edge is power. As I learn the laws of learning I use them to manipu­
late others through advertisements, through propaganda, through 
prediction of their responses and the control of those responses. It 
is not too strong a statement to say that the growth of knowledge 
in the social sciences contains within itself a powerful tendency 
toward social control, toward control of the many by the few. An 
equally strong tendency is toward the weakening or destruction 
of the existential person. When all are regarded as objects, the sub­

214
R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
jective individual, the inner self, the person in the process of becom­
ing, the unrcflective consciousness of being, the whole inward side 
of living life, is weakened, devalued, or destroyed. Perhaps this is 
best exemplified by two books. Skinner’s Walden Tw o is a psychol­
ogist’s picture of paradise. T o  Skinner it must have seemed de­
sirable, unless he wrote it as a tremendous satire. A t any rate it is a 
paradise of manipulation, in which the extent to which one can be 
a person is greatly reduced, unless one can be a member of the rul­
ing council. Huxley’s Brave N ew  World is frankly satire, but por­
trays vividly the loss of personhood which he sees as associated with 
increasing psychological and biological knowledge. Thus, to put 
it bluntly, it seems that a developing social science (as now con­
ceived and pursued) leads to social dictatorship and individual loss 
of personhood. The dangers perceived by Kierkegaard a century 
ago in this respect seem much more real now, with the increase of 
knowledge, than they could have then.”
4. 
“Finally,” says the experientialist, “ doesn’t all this point to the 
fact that ethics is a more basic consideration than science? I am 
not blind to the value of science as a tool, and am aware that it can 
be a very valuable tool. But unless it is the tool of ethical persons, 
with all that the term persons implies, may it not become a Jugger­
naut? We have been a long time recognizing this issue, because in 
physical science it took centuries for the ethical issue to become 
crucial, but it has at last become so. In the social sciences the ethical 
issues arise much more quickly, because persons are involved. But 
in psychotherapy the issue arises most quickly and most deeply. 
Here is the maximizing of all that is subjective, inward, personal; 
here a relationship is lived, not examined, and a person, not an ob­
ject, emerges; a person who feels, chooses, believes, acts, not as an 
automaton, but as a person. And here too is the ultimate in science
— the objective exploration of the most subjective aspects of life; 
the reduction to hypotheses, and eventually to theorems, of all that 
has been regarded as most personal, most completely inward, most 
thoroughly a private world. And because these two views come so 
sharply into focus here, we must make a choice — an ethical per­
sonal choice of values. We may do it by default, by not raising the 
question. W e may be able to make a choice which will somehow

Persons or Science?
215
conserve both values — but choose we must. And I am asking that 
we think long and hard before we give up the values that pertain to 
being a person, to experiencing, to living a relationship, to becoming, 
that pertain to one’s self as a process, to one’s self in the existential 
moment, to the inward subjective self that lives.”
T h e D il e m m a
There you have the contrary views as they occur sometimes ex­
plicitly, more often implicitly, in current psychological thinking. 
There you have the debate as it exists in me. Where do we go? 
What direction do we take? 
Has the problem been correctly 
described or is it fallacious? W hat are the errors of perception? 
Or if it is essentially as described, must we choose one or the other? 
And if so, which one? Or is there some broader, more inclusive 
formulation which can happily encompass both of these views with­
out damage to either?
A  C h a n g e d  V ie w  o k S c ie n c e
In the year which has elapsed since the foregoing material was 
written, I have from time to time discussed the issues with students, 
colleagues and friends. T o  some of them I am particularly indebted 
for ideas which have taken root in me.* Gradually I have come to 
believe that the most basic error in the original formulation was 
in the description of science. I should like, in this section, to attempt 
to correct that error, and in the following section to reconcile the 
revised points of view.
The major shortcoming wras, I believe, in viewing science as some­
thing “out there,” something spelled with a capital S, a “body of 
knowledge” existing somewhere in space and time. In common with 
many psychologists I thought of science as a systematized and or-
• 
I would like to mention my special debt to discussions with, and published 
and unpublished papers by Robert M. Lipgar, Ross L. Alooney, David A. 
Rodgers and Eugene Streich. My own thinking has fed so deeply on theirs, 
and become so intertwined with theirs, that I would be at a loss to acknowledge 
specific obligations. I only know that in what follows there is much which 
springs from them, through me. I have also profited from correspondence 
regarding the paper with Anne Roe and W alter Smet.

ganized collection of tentatively verified facts, and saw the methodol­
ogy of science as the socially approved means of accumulating this 
body of knowledge, and continuing its verification. It has seemed 
somewhat like a reservoir into which all and sundry may dip their 
buckets to obtain water — with a guarantee of 99% purity. When 
viewed in this external and impersonal fashion, it seems not un­
reasonable to see Science not only as discovering knowledge in lofty 
fashion, but as involving depersonalization, a tendency to manipu­
late, a denial of the basic freedom of choice which I have met ex- 
perientially in therapy. I should like now to view the scientific 
approach from a different, and I hope, a more accurate perspective.
S c ie n c e in  P er so n s
Science exists only in people. Each scientific project has its crea­
tive inception, its process, and its tentative conclusion, in a person 
or persons. Know ledge — even scientific knowledge — is that which 
is subjectively acceptable. Scientific know ledge can be communi­
cated only to those w ho are subjectively ready to receive its com­
munication. The utilization of science also occurs only through 
people who are in pursuit of values which have meaning for them. 
These statements summarize very briefly something of the change 
in emphasis which I would like to make in my description of science. 
Let me follow through the various phases of science from this point 
of view.
Tiik C r e a tiv e P h a se 
Science has its inception in a particular person who is pursuing 
aims, values, purposes, which have personal and subjective meaning 
for him. As a part of this pursuit, he, in some area, “ wants to find 
out.” Consequently, if he is to be a good scientist, he immerses 
himself in the relevant experience, whether that be the physics 
laboratory, the world of plant or animal life, the hospital, the psycho­
logical laboratory or clinic, or whatever. This immersion is com­
plete and subjective, similar to the immersion of the therapist in 
therapy, described previously. He senses the field in which he is 
interested, he lives it. He does more than “ think” about it — he lets 
his organism take over and react to it, both on a knowing and on an

Persons or Science?
217
unknowing level. He comes to sense more than he could possibly 
verbalize about his field, and reacts organismically in terms of re­
lationships which are not present in his awareness.
Out of this complete subjective immersion comes a creative 
forming, a sense of direction, a vague formulation of relationships 
hitherto unrecognized. Whittled down, sharpened, formulated in 
clearer terms, this creative forming becomes a hypothesis — a state­
ment of a tentative, personal, subjective faith. The scientist is saying, 
drawing upon all his knowrn and unknown experience, that “ I have 
a hunch that such and such a relationship exists, and the existence 
of this phenomenon has relevance to my personal values.”
What I am describing is the initial phase of science, probably its 
most important phase, but one which American scientists, particu­
larly psychologists, have been prone to minimize or ignore. It is not 
so much that it has been denied as that it has been quickly brushed 
off. Kenneth Spence has said that this aspect of science is “simply 
taken for granted.” * Like many experiences taken for granted, it 
also tends to be forgotten. It is indeed in the matrix of immcdinrc 
personal, subjective experience that all science, and each individual 
scientific research, has its origin.
C h e c k in g  w it h  R e a l it y
The scientist has then creatively achieved his hypothesis, his ten­
tative faith. But does it check with reality? Experience has shown 
each one of us that it is very easy to deceive ourselves, to believe 
something which later experience shows is not so. How can I tell 
whether this tentative belief has some real relationship to observed 
facts? I can use, not one line of evidence only, but several. I can 
surround my observation of the facts with various precautions to 
make sure I am not deceiving myself. I can consult with others
• 
It may be pertinent to quote the scntcnces from which this phrase is 
taken. “ . . . the data of all sciences have the same origin —  namely, the imme­
diate experience of an observing person, the scientist himself. That is to say, 
immediate experience, the initial matrix out of which all sc ie n c e s develop, is no 
longer considered a matter of concern for the scientist qua scientist. He simply 
takes it for granted and then proceeds to the task of describing the events 
occurring in it and discovering and formulating the nature of the relationships 
holding among them.” Kenneth XV. Spcncc, in Psychological Theory, cd. liy

who have also been concerned w'ith avoiding self-deception, and 
learn useful ways of catching myself in unwarranted beliefs, based 
on misinterpretation of observations. I can, in short, begin to use all 
the elaborate methodology which science has accumulated. I dis­
cover that stating my hypothesis in operational terms will avoid 
many blind alleys and false conclusions. 1
 learn that control groups 
can help me to avoid drawing false inferences. I learn that correla­
tions, and t tests and critical ratios and a whole array of statistical pro­
cedures can likewise aid me in drawing only reasonable inferences.
Thus scientific methodology is seen for what it truly is —  a way 
of preventing me from deceiving myself in regard to my creatively 
formed subjective hunches which have developed out of the rela­
tionship between me and my material. It is in this context, and per­
haps only in this context, that the vast structure of operationism, 
logical positivism, research design, tests of significance, etc. have 
their place. They exist, not for themselves, but as servants in the 
attempt to check the subjective feeling or hunch or hypothesis of a 
person with the objective fact.
And even throughout the use of such rigorous and impersonal 
methods, the important choices are all made subjectively by the 
scientist. T o  which of a number of hypotheses shall I devote time? 
What land of control group is most suitable for avoiding self-decep­
tion in this particular research? H ow  far shall I carry the statistical 
analysis? How  much credence may I place in the findings? Each 
of these is necessarily a subjective personal judgment, emphasizing 
that the splendid structure of science rests basically upon its sub­
jective use by persons. It is the best instrument we have yet been 
able to devise to check upon our organismic sensing of the universe.
T h e F in d in g s
If, as scientist, I like the way I have gone about my investigation, 
if I have been open to all the evidence, if I have selected and used 
intelligently all the precautions against self-deception which I have 
been able to assimilate from others or to devise myself, then I will 
give my tentative belief to the findings which have emerged. I will 
regard them as a springboard for further investigation and further 
seeking.

Versons or Science?
219
It seems to me that in the best of science, the primary purpose is 
to provide a more satisfactory and dependable hypothesis, belief, 
faith, for the investigator himself. T o the extent that the scientist is 
endeavoring to prove something to someone else — an error into 
which I have fallen more than once — then I believe he is using sci­
ence to bolster a personal insecurity, and is keeping it from its truly 
creative role in the service of the person.
In regard to the findings of science, the subjective foundation is 
well shown in the fact that at times the scientist may refuse to be­
lieve his own findings. “The experiment showed thus and so, but I 
believe it is wrong,” is a theme which every scientist has experienced 
at some time or other. Some very fruitful discoveries have grown 
out of the persistent disbelief, by a scientist, in his own findings and 
those of others. In the last analysis he may place more trust in his 
total organismic reactions than in the methods of science. There is 
no doubt that this can result in serious error as well as in scientific 
discoveries, but it indicates again the leading place of the subjective 
in the use of science.

Wading along a coral reef in the Caribbean this morning, I saw a 
large blue fish — I think. If you, quite independently, saw it too, 
then I feel more confident in my own observation. This is what is 
known as intersubjective verification, and it plays an important part 
in our understanding of science. If I take you (whether in conver­
sation or in print or behaviorally) through the steps I have taken in 
an investigation, and it seems to you too that I have not deceived my­
self, and that I have indeed come across a new relationship which is 
relevant to my values, and that I am justified in having a tentative 
faith in this relationship, then we have the beginnings of Science with 
a capital S. It is at this point that we are likely to think we have 
created a body of scientific knowledge. Actually there is no such 
body of knowledge. There are only tentative beliefs, existing sub­
jectively, in a number of different persons. If these beliefs arc not 
tentative, then what exists is dogma, not science. If on the other 
hand, no one but the investigator believes the finding then this find­
ing is either a personal and deviant matter, an instance of psycho­

220
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
pathology, or else it is an unusual truth discovered by a genius, which 
as yet no one is subjectively ready to believe. This leads me to 
comment on the group which can put tentative faith in any given 
scientific finding.
C o m m u n ic a t io n  to W h o m ?
It is clear that scientific findings can be communicated only to 
those who have agreed to the same ground rules of investigation. 
The Australian bushman will be quire unimpressed with the findings 
of science regarding bacterial infection. He knows that illness truly 
is caused by evil spirits. It is only w hen he too agrees to scientific 
method as a good means of preventing sclf-dcception, that lie will be 
likely to accept its findings.
But even among those who have adopted the ground rules of 
scicnce, tentative belief in the findings of a scientific research can 
only occur where there is a subjective readiness to believe. One 
could find many examples. Most psychologists are quite ready to be­
lieve evidence showing that the lecture system produces significant 
increments of learning, and quite unready to believe that the turn 
of an unseen card may be called through an ability labelled extra­
sensory perception. Yet the scientific evidence for the latter is con­
siderably more impeccable than for the former. Likewise when the 
so-called “ Iowa studies” first came out, indicating that intelligence 
might be considerably altered by environmental conditions, there 
was great disbelief among psychologists, and many attacks on the 
imperfect scientific methods used. The scientific evidence for this 
finding is not much better today than it was when the Iowa studies 
first appeared, but the subjective readiness of psychologists to be­
lieve such a finding has altered greatly. A historian of science has 
noted that empiricists, had they existed at the time, would have been 
the first to disbelieve the findings of Copernicus.
It appears then that whether I believe the scientific findings of 
others, or those from my own studies, depends in part on my readi­
ness to put a tentative belief in such findings.* One reason we are

One example from my own experience may suffice. In 1941 a research 
study done under my supervision showed that the future adjustment of

not particularly aware of this subjective fact is that in the physical 
sciences particularly, we have gradually adopted a very large area of 
experience in which we are ready to believe any finding which can 
be shown to rest upon the rules of the scientific game, properly 
played.
T h e U s e  o f S c ie n c e 
But not only is the origin, process, and conclusion of science 
something which exists only in the subjective experience of persons
— so also is its utilization. “Science” will never depersonalize, or 
manipulate, or control individuals. It is only persons who can and 
will do that. That is surely a most obvious and trite observation, yet 
a deep realization of it has had much meaning for me. It means that 
the use which will be made of scientific findings in the field of per­
sonality is and will be a matter of subjective personal choice — the 
same type of choice as a person makes in therapy. T o the extent that 
he has defensively closed off areas of his experience from awareness, 
the person is more likely to make choices which are socially destruc­
tive. T o  the extent that he is open to all phases of his experience we 
nvay be sure that this person wrill be more likely to use the findings 
and methods of science (or any other tool or capacity) in a manner 
which is personally and socially constructive.* There is, in actuality 
then, no threatening entity of “ Science” which can in any way affect 
our destiny. There are only people. While many of them are indeed
delinquent adolescents was best predicted by a measure of their realistic self- 
understanding and self-acceptance. The instrument was a crude one, but it 
was a better predictor than measures of family environment, hereditary capaci­
ties, social milieu, and the like. At that time I was simply not ready to believe 
such a finding, because my own belief, like that of most psychologists, was that 
such factors as the emotional climate in the family and the influence of the 
peer group were the real determinants of fumre delinquency and non-delin­
quency. Only gradually’, as my experience with psychotherapy continued and 
deepened, was it possible for me to give my tentative belief to the findings of 
this study and of a later one (1944) which confirmed it. (For a report of these 
two studies see “The role of self-understanding in the prediction of behavior”

threatening and dangerous in their defensiveness, and modern sci­
entific knowledge multiplies the social threat and danger, this is not 
the whole picture. There are two other significant facets. (1) There 
are many persons who are relatively open to their experience and 
hence likely to be socially constructive. 
(2) Both the subjective 
experience of psychotherapy and the scientific findings regarding 
it indicate that individuals are motivated to change, and may be 
helped to change, in the direction of greater openness to experience, 
and hence in the direction of behavior which is enhancing of self and 
society, rather than destructive.
T o put it briefly, Science can never threaten us. Only persons can 
do that. And while individuals can be vastly destructive with the 
tools placed in their hands by scientific knowledge, this is only one 
side of the picture. W e already have subjective and objective knowl­
edge of the basic principles by which individuals may achieve the 
more constructive social behavior which is natural to their organis- 
mic process of becoming.
A  N e w  I n t e g r a t io n
W hat this line of thought has achieved for me is a fresh integra­
tion in which the conflict between the “experientialist” and the 
“scientist” tends to disappear. This particular integration may not be 
acceptable to others, but it does have meaning to me. Its major tenets 
have been largely implicit in the preceding section, but I will try to 
state them here in a way which takes cognizance of the arguments 
between the opposing points of view.
Science, as well as therapy, as well as all other aspects of living, 
is rooted in and based upon the immediate, subjective experience of a 
person. It springs from the inner, total, organismic experiencing 
which is only partially and imperfectly communicable. It is one 
phase of subjective living.
It is because I find value and reward in human relationships that 
I enter into a relationship known as therapeutic, where feelings and 
cognition merge into one unitary experience which is lived rather

Persons or Science?
223
than examined, in which awareness is non-reflective, and w
T
here I 
am participant rather than observer. But because I am curious about 
the exquisite orderliness which appears to exist in the universe and in 
this relationship I can abstract myself from the experience and look 
upon it as an observer, making myself and/or others the objects of 
that observation. As observer I use all of the hunches which grow 
out of the living experience. T o avoid deceiving myself as observer, 
to gain a more accurate picture of the order which exists, I make use 
of all the canons of science. Science is not an impersonal something, 
but simply a person living subjectively another phase of himself. A 
deeper understanding of therapy (or of any other problem) may 
come from living it, or from observing it in accordance with the 
rules of science, or from the communication within the self between 
the two types of experience. As to the subjective experience of 
choice, it is not only primary in therapy, but it is also primary in the 
use of scientific method by a person.
What I will do with the knowledge gained through scientific 
method — whether I will use it to understand, enhance, enrich, or 
use it to control, manipulate and destroy — is a matter of subjec­
tive choice dependent upon the values which have personal mean­
ing for me. If, out of fright and defensiveness, I block out from my 
awareness large areas of experience, — if I can see only those facts 
which support my present beliefs, and am blind to all others — if I 
can see only the objective aspects of life, and cannot perceive the 
subjective — if in any way I cut off my perception from the full 
range of its actual sensitivity — then I am likely to be socially de­
structive, whether I use as tool the knowledge and instruments of 
science, or the power and emotional strength of a subjective rela­
tionship. And on the other hand if I am open to my experience, and 
can permit all of the sensings of my intricate organism to be avail­
able to my awareness, then I am likely to use myself, my subjective 
experience, and my scientific knowledge, in ways which are realisti­
cally constructive.
This then is the degree of integration I have currently been able 
to achieve between two approaches first experienced as conflicting. 
It does not completely resolve all the issues posed in the earlier sec­

224
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
tion, but it seems to point toward a resolution. It rewrites the prob­
lem or rcperceives the issue, by putting the subjective, existential 
person, with the values which he holds, at the foundation and the 
root of the therapeutic relationship and of the scicntific relationship. 
For science too, at its inception, is an “ I-Thou” relationship with a 
person or persons. And only as a subjective person can I enter into 
either of these relationships.

t is t h e  p u r po se of this paper to present some of the high lights 
of the experience which I and my colleagues have had as we 
endeavored to measure, by objective scientific methods, the out­
comes of one form of individual psychotherapy. In order to make 
these high lights understandable, I shall describe briefly the context 
in wrhich this research undertaking has been carried on.
For many years I have been working, with my psychologist col­
leagues, in the field of psychotherapy. W e have been trying to 
learn, from our experience in carrying on psychotherapy, what is 
effective in bringing about constructive change in the personality 
and behavior of the maladjusted or disturbed person seeking help. 
Gradually we have formulated an approach to psychotherapy, based 
upon this experience, which has variously been termed non-directive 
or client-centered. 
This approach and its theoretical rationale have 
been described in a number of books (1, 2, 5, 6, 8) and many articles.
It has been one of our persistent aims to subject the dynamics of 
therapy and the results of therapy to rigorous research investigation. 
It is our belief that psychotherapy is a deeply subjective existential 
experience in both client and therapist, full of complex subtleties, 
and involving many nuances of personal interaction. Yet it is also 
our conviction that if this experience is a significant one, in which 
deep learnings bring about personality change, then such changes 
should be amenable to research investigation.
Over the past fourteen years we have made many such research 
studies, of both the process and the outcomes of this form of 
therapy. (Sec 5, particularly chapters 2, 4, and 7, for a summarized 
account of this body of research.) During the past five years, at the 
Counseling Center of the University of Chicago, we have been push­
ing forward the boundaries of such research by means of a co­
ordinated series of investigations designed to throw light upon the 
outcomes of this form of psychotherapy. It is from this current re­
search program that I wish to present certain significant features.

T h r e e A s p e c t s o f O u r R esea r c h
The three aspects of our research which would, I believe, have the 
greatest amount of meaning to this audience, are these.
1. The criteria which we have used in our study of psychotherapy, 
criteria which depart from conventional thinking in this area.
2. The design of the research, in which we have solved certain dif­
ficulties which have hitherto stood in the way of clear-cut results.
3. The progress we have made in measuring subtle subjective 
phenomena in an objective fashion.
These three elements in our program could be utilized in any at­
tempt to measure personality change. They are therefore applicable 
to investigations of any form of psychotherapy, or to the research 
study of any procedure designed to bring about alteration in per­
sonality or behavior.
Let us now turn to these three elements I have mentioned, taking 
them up in order.
T h e C r it er ia fo r t h e  R esea r c h
W hat is the criterion for research in psychotherapy? This is a 
most perplexing issue which we faced early in our planning. There is 
widespread acceptance of the idea that the purpose of research in 
this field is to measure the degree of “success” in psychotherapy, or 
the degree of “cure” achieved. While we have not been uninfluenced 
by such thinking, we have, after careful consideration, given up 
these concepts because they are undefinable, are essentially value 
judgments, and hence cannot be a part of the science of this field. 
There is no general agreement as to what constitutes “success” — 
whether it is removal of symptoms, resolution of conflicts, improve­
ment in social behavior, or some other type of change. The concept 
of “cure” is entirely inappropriate, since in most of these disorders 
we are dealing with learned behavior, not with a disease.
As a consequence of our thinking, we have not asked in our re­
search, “W as success achieved? W as the condition cured?” Instead 
we have asked a question which is scientifically much more de­
fensible, namely, “W hat are the concomitants of therapy?”

228
R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
In order to have a basis for answering this question we have taken 
the theory of psychotherapy w'hich we have been developing and 
have drawn from it the theoretical description of those changes 
which we hypothesized as occurring in therapy. The purpose of the 
research is to determine whether the changes which are hypothesized 
do or do not occur in measurable degree. Thus from the theory of 
client-centered therapy wre have drawrn hypotheses such as these: 
during therapy feelings which have previously been denied to aware­
ness are experienced, and are assimilated into the concept of self; 
during therapy the concept of the self becomes more congruent with 
the concept of the ideal self; during and after therapy the observed 
behavior of the client becomes more socialized and mature; during 
and after therapy the client increases in attitudes of self-acceptance, 
and this is correlated with an increase in acceptance of others.
These are a few of the hypotheses we have been able to investi­
gate. It will perhaps be clear that we have abandoned entirely the 
idea of one general criterion for our studies, and have substituted 
instead a number of clearly defined variables, each one specific to the 
hypothesis being investigated. This means that it was our hope in 
the research to be able to state our conclusions in some such form 
as this: that client-centered psychotherapy produces measurable 
changes in characteristics a, b, d, and f, for example, but does not 
produce changes in variables c and e. When statements of this sort 
are available then the professional worker and the layman will be in a 
position to make a value judgment as to whether he regards as a 
“success” a process which produces these changes. 
Such value 
judgments will not, however, alter the solid facts in our slowly 
growing scientific knowledge of the effective dynamics of person­
ality change.
Thus in our research we have, in place of the usual global criterion 
of “success,” many specific criterion variables, each drawn from our 
theory of therapy, and each operationally defined.
This resolution of the problem of criteria was of great help in 
making an intelligent selection of research instruments to use in our 
battery of test. W e did not ask the unanswerable question as to 
what instruments would measure success or cure. W e asked instead, 
specific questions related to each hypothesis. W hat instrument can

229
he used to measure the individual’s conccpt of self? What instru­
ment will give a satisfactory measure of maturity of behavior? I low 
can we measure the degree of an individual’s acceptance of others? 
While questions such as these arc difficult, operational answers are 
discoverable. Thus our decision in regard to criteria gave us much 
help in solving the whole problem of instrumentation of the re­
search.
T iif. D esig n  o f t h e R esea rch
The fact that there has been no objective evidence of constructive 
personality change brought about by psychotherapy, has been 
mentioned by a number of thoughtful writers. Hebb states that 
“there is no body of fact to show that psychotherapy is valuable” 
(4, p. 271). Eysenck, after surveying some of the available studies, 
points out that the data “ fail to prove that psychotherapy, Freudian 
or otherwise, facilitates the recovery of neurotic patients” (3, p. 
322).
Mindful of this regrettable situation we were eager to set up our 
investigation in a sufficiently rigorous fashion that the confirmation 
or disproof of our hypotheses would establish two points: (a) that 
significant change had or had not occurred, and (b) that such change, 
if it did occur, was attributable to the therapy and not to some other 
factor. In such a complex field as therapy it is not easy to devise a 
research design which will accomplish these aims, but we believe that 
we have made real progress in this direction.
Having chosen the hypotheses which we wished to test, and the 
instruments most suitable for their operational measurement, we 
were now ready for the next step. This selected scries of objective 
research instruments were used to measure various characteristics 
of a group of clients before their therapy, after the completion of 
therapy, and at a followup point six months to one year later, as 
indicated in Figure 1. The clients were roughly typical of those 
coming to the Counseling Center of the University of Chicago, and 
the aim was to collect this data, including the recording of all inter­
views, for at least 25 clicnts. The choice was made to make an in­
tensive study of a group of moderate size, rather than a more super­
ficial analysis of a larger number.

A part of the therapy group was set aside as an own-control 
group. This group was given the battery of research instruments, 
asked to wait during a two month control period, and then given 
the battery a second time before counseling. The rationale of this 
procedure is that if change occurs in individuals simply because they 
are motivated for therapy, or because they have a certain type of 
personality structure, then such change should occur during this 
control period.
Another group of individuals not in therapy was selected as an 
equivalent-control group. This group was equivalent in age and age 
distribution to the therapy group, and roughly equivalent in socio­
economic status, in the proportion of men and women, and of stu­
dents and non-students. This group was given the same tests as the 
therapy group, at matched time intervals. A portion of this group 
was given the test battery four times, in order to make them strictly
Figure 1
 
Research Design

Personality Change in Psychotherapy
231
comparable to the own-control therapy group. The rationalt of this 
equivalent-control group is that if change occurs in individuals as 
the result of the passage of time, or the influence of random vari­
ables, or as an artifact of the repeated administration of tests, then 
such change should be evident in the findings from this group.
The over-all logic of this doubly controlled design is that if the 
therapy group shows changes during and after the therapy period 
which are significantly greater than those which occur in the own- 
control period or in the equivalent-control group, then it is reason­
able to attribute these changes to the influence of the therapy.
I cannot, in this brief report, go into the complex and ramified 
details of the various projects which were carried out within the 
framework of this research design. A more complete account (7) 
has been prepared which describes thirteen of the projects completed 
thus far. Suffice to say that complete data on 29 clients, dealt with 
by 16 therapists, was obtained, as well as complete data on a matched 
control group. The careful evaluation of the research findings 
enables us to draw certain conclusions such as these: That profound 
changes occur in the perceived self of the client during and after 
therapy; that there is constructive change in the client’s personality 
characteristics and personality structure, changes which bring him 
closer to the personality characteristics of the well-functioning per­
son; that there is change in directions defined as personal integration 
and adjustment; that there are changes in the maturity of the client’s 
behavior as observed by friends. In each instance the change is 
significantly greater than that found in the control group or in the 
clients during the own-control period. Only in regard to the hy­
potheses having to do with acceptant and democratic attitudes in 
relation to others are the findings somewhat confused and am­
biguous.
In our judgment, the research program which has already been 
completed has been sufficient to modify such statements as those 
made by Hebb and Eysenck. In regard to client-sponsored psycho­
therapy, at least, there is now objective evidence of positive changes 
in personality and behavior in directions which are usually regarded 
as constructive and these changes arc attributable to the therapy. It 
is the adoption of multiple specific research criteria and the use of a

232
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
rigorously controlled research design which makes it possible to 
make such a statement.
T hf. M e a s u r e m e n t  o f C h a n g es in  t h e  S e l f
Since I can only present a very small sample of the results, I will 
select this sample from the area in which we feel there has been the 
most significant advance in methodology, and the most provocative 
findings, namely, our attempts to measure the changes in the client’s 
perception of himself, and the relationship of self-perception to cer­
tain other variables.
In order to obtain an objective indication of the client’s self-per­
ception, we made use of the newly devised Q-technique, developed 
by Stephenson (9). A large “universe” of self-descriptive statements 
was drawn from recorded interviews and other sources. Some typi­
cal statements are: “ I am a submissive person” ; “ I don’t trust my 
emotions” ; “I feel relaxed and nothing bothers me” ; “I am afraid of 
sex” ; “I usually like people” ; “I have an attractive personality” ; “I 
am afraid of what other people think of me.” A random sample of 
one hundred of these, edited for clarity, was used as the instrument. 
Theoretically we now had a sampling of all the ways in which an in­
dividual could perceive himself. These hundred statements, each 
printed on a card, were given to the client. He was asked to sort 
the cards to represent himself “as of now,” sorting the cards into 
nine piles from those items most characteristic of himself to those 
least characteristic. He was told to place a certain number of items 
in each pile so as to give an approximately normal distribution of the 
items. The client sorted the cards in this way at each of the major 
points, before therapy, after, and at the followup point, and also on 
several occasions during therapy. Each time that he sorted the cards 
to picture himself he was also asked to sort them to represent the 
self he would like to be, his ideal self.
We thus had detailed and objective representations of the client’s 
self-pcrception at various points, and his perception of his ideal self. 
These various sortings were then inter-correlated, a high correlation 
between two sortings indicating similarity or lack of change, a low 
correlation indicating a dissimilarity, or a marked degree of change.
In order to illustrate the way in which this instrument was used to

Personality Change in Psychotherapy
233
test some of our hypotheses in regard to the self, I am going to pre­
sent some of the findings from the study of one client (from 7, ch. 
15) as they relate to several hypotheses. I believe this will indicate 
the provocative nature of the results more adequately than presenting 
the general conclusions from our study of self-perception, though 
I will try to mention these generalized results in passing.
The client from whose data I will draw material was a woman 
of 40, most unhappy in her marriage. Her adolescent daughter had 
had a nervous breakdown, about which she felt guilty. She was a 
rather deeply troubled person who was rated on diagnostic measures 
as seriously neurotic. She was not a member of the own-control 
group, so entered therapy immediately after taking the first battery 
of tests. She came for 40 interviews over a period of 5 /2
 months, 
when she concluded therapy. Followup tests wrere administered 
seven months later, and at that time she decided to come in for 8 
more interviews. A second followup study was done 5 months later. 
The counselor judged that there had been very considerable move­
ment in therapy.
Figure 2 presents some of the data regarding the changing self- 
perception of this client. Each circle represents a sorting for the 
ideal self or the self. Sortings were done before therapy, after the 
seventh and twenty-fifth interviews, at the end of therapy, and at 
the first and second followup points. The correlations are given be­
tween many of these sortings.
Let us now examine this data in reference to one of the hypotheses 
which we were interested in testing, namely, that the perceived self 
of the client will change more during therapy than during a period 
of no therapy. In this particular case the change was greater during 
therapy (r =  .39) than during either of the followup periods 
(r= 7 4 , .70) or the whole twelve month period of followup 
(r =  .65). Thus the hypothesis is upheld in this one case. In this 
respect she was characteristic of our clients, the general finding being 
that the change in the perceived self during therapy was significantly 
greater than during the control or followup periods, and significantly 
greater than the change occurring in the control group.
Let us consider a second hypothesis. It was predicted that during 
and after therapy the perceived self would be more positively valued,

Figure 2 
The changing relationships between Self and Self-Ideal

Personality Change in Psychotherapy
235
i.e., would become more congruent with the ideal, or valued, self.
This client exhibits considerable discrepancy between the self she 
is and the self she would like to be, when she first comes in 
(r =  .21). During and after therapy this discrepancy decreases, a de­
cided degree of congruence existing at the final followup study 
(r =  .79), thus confirming our hypothesis. This is typical of our 
general findings, which showed a significant increase in congruence 
between self and ideal, during therapy, for the group as a whole.
Close study of Figure 2 will show that by the end of our study, 
the client perceives herself as having become very similar to the 
person she wanted to be when she came in (rIB’SF2 =  .70). It may 
also be noted that her final self-ideal became slightly more similar 
to her initial self (rSB*IF2 =  .36) than was her initial ideal.
Let us briefly consider another hypothesis, that the change in the 
perceived self will not be random, but will be in a direction which 
expert judges would term adjustment.
As one part of our study the Q-sort cards were given to a group 
of clinical psychologists not associated with the research, and they 
were asked to sort the cards as they would be sorted by a “well-ad­
justed” person- This gave us a criterion sorting with which the sclf- 
perception of any client could be compared. A simple score was 
developed to express the degree of similarity between the client’s 
self-perception and this representation of the “adjusted” person. 
This was called the “adjustment score,” higher scores indicating a 
higher degree of “adjustment.”
In the case of the client we have been considering the adjustment 
scores for the six succcssive self-sorts shown in Figure 2, beginning 
with the self as perceived before therapy, and ending at the second 
followup point, are as follows: 35, 44, 41, 52, 54, 51. The trend 
toward improved adjustment, as operationally defined, is evident 
This is also true for the group as a whole, a marked increase in 
adjustment score occurring over the period of therapy, and a very 
slight regression in score during the followup period. There was 
essentially no change in the control individuals. Thus, both for 
this particular client, and for the group as a w
 hole, our hypothesis 
is upheld.
When a qualitative analysis of the different self-sorts is made,

236
R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
the findings further confirm this hypothesis. When the initial self­
picture is compared with those after therapy, it is found that after 
therapy the client sees herself as changed in a number of ways. She 
feels she is more self-confident and self-reliant, understands herself 
better, has more inner comfort, and more comfortable relationships 
with others. She feels less guilty, less resentful, less driven and in­
secure, and feels less need for self-concealment. These qualitative 
changes are similar to those shown by the other clients in the re­
search and are in general in accord with the theory of client-ccn- 
tercd therapy.
1
 should like to point out certain additional findings of interest 
which arc illustrated in Figure 2.
It will be evident that the representation of the ideal self is much 
more stable than the representation of the self. The inter-corrcla- 
tions are all above .70, and the conception of the person she would 
like to be changes relatively little over the whole period. This is 
characteristic of almost all of our clients. While we had formulated 
no hypothesis on this point it had been our expectation that some 
clients would achieve greater congruence of self and ideal primarily 
through alteration of their values, others through the alteration of 
self. Our evidence thus far indicates that this is incorrect, and that 
with only occasional exceptions, it appears to be the concept of the 
self which exhibits the greater change.
Some change, however, does occur in the ideal self in the case of 
our client and the direction of this slight change is of interest. If 
we calculate the previously described “adjustment score” of the 
successive representations of the ideal self of this client, we find 
that the average score for the first three is 57, but the average of 
the three following therapy is 51. In other words the self-ideal has 
become less perfectly “ adjusted,” or more attainable. It is to some 
degree a less punishing goal. In this respect also, this client is char­
acteristic of the trend in the whole group.
Another finding has to do with the “remembered self* which is 
shown in Figure 2. This sorting was obtained by asking the client, 
at the time of the second followup study, to sort the cards once 
more to represent herself as she was when she first entered therapy. 
This remembered self turned out to be very different from the self- 
picture she had given at the time of entering therapy. It correlated

Personality Change in Psychotherapy
237
only .44 with the self-representation given at that time. Further­
more, it was a much less favorable picture of her self, being far 
more discrepant from her ideal (r =  —.21), and having a low adjust­
ment score — a score of 26 compared to a score of 35 for the initial 
self-picture. This suggests that in this sorting for the remembered 
self we have a crude objective measure of the reduction in defensive­
ness which has occurred over the eighteen-month period of our 
study. At the final contact she is able to give a considerably truer 
picture of the maladjusted and disturbed person that she was when 
she entered therapy, a picture which is confirmed by other evidence, 
as we shall see. Thus the degree of alteration in the self over the 
total period of a year and a half is perhaps better represented by the 
correlation of —.13 between the remembered self and the final self, 
than by the correlation of .30 between the initial and final self.
Let us now turn to a consideration of one more hypothesis. In 
client-centered therapy our theory is that in the psychological safety 
of the therapeutic relationship the client is able to permit in his 
awareness feelings and experiences which ordinarily would be re­
pressed, or denied to awareness. These previously denied experiences 
now become incorporated into the self. For example, a client who 
has repressed all feelings of hostility may come, during therapy, to 
experience his hostility freely. His concept of himself then becomes 
reorganized to include this realization that he has, at times, hostile 
feelings toward others. His self-picture becomes to that degree a 
more accurate map or representation of the totality of his experi­
ence.
We endeavored to translate this portion of our theory into an 
operational hypothesis, which we expressed in this way: During and 
after therapy there will be an increasing congruence between the 
self as perceived by the client and the client as perceived by a 
diagnostician. The assumption is that a skilled person making a psy­
chological diagnosis of the client is more aware of the totality of the 
client’s experience patterns, both conscious and unconscious, than 
is the client. Hence if the client assimilates into his own conscious 
self-picture many of the feelings and experiences which previously 
he has repressed, then his picture of himself should become more 
similar to the picture which the diagnostician has of him.
The method of investigating this hypothesis was to take the pro­

238
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
jective test (the Thematic Apperception Test) which had been ad­
ministered to the client at each point and have these four tests 
examined by a diagnostician. In order to avoid any bias, this psy­
chologist was not told the order in which the tests had been adminis­
tered. He was then asked to sort the Q-cards for each one of the 
tests to represent the client as she diagnostically was at that time. 
This procedure gave us an unbiased diagnostic evaluation, expressed 
in terms of the same instrument as the client had used to portray 
herself, so that a direct and objective comparison was possible, 
through correlation of the different Q-sorts.
The result of this study, for this particular client, is shown in 
Figure 3. The upper portion of this diagram is simply a condensa­
tion of the information from Figure 2. The lowest row shows the 
sortings made by the diagnostician, and the correlations enable us 
to test our hypothesis. It will be observed that at the beginning of 
therapy there is no relationship between the client’s perception of 
herself and the diagnostician’s perception of the client (r =  .00). 
Even at the end of therapy the situation is the same (r =  .05). But 
by the time of the first followup (not shown) and the second 
followup, the client’s perception of herself has become substantially 
like the diagnostician’s perception of her (first followup, r =  .56; 
second followup, r =  .55). Thus the hypothesis is clearly upheld, 
congruence between the self as perceived by the client and the 
client as perceived by a diagnostician having significantly increased.
There are other findings from this aspect of the study which are 
of interest. It will be noted that at the time of beginning therapy 
the client as perceived by the diagnostician is very dissimilar to the 
ideal she had for herself (r =  —
 .42). By the end of the study the 
diagnostician sees her as being decidedly similar to her ideal at that 
time (r =  .46) and even more similar to the ideal she held for her­
self at the time she came in (r =  .61). Thus we may say that the 
objective evidence indicates that the client has become, in her 
self-perception and in her total personality picture, substantially the 
person she wished to become when she entered therapy.
Another noteworthy point is that the change in the diagnostician’s 
perception of the client is considerably sharper than is the change 
in the perceived self of the client (r =  —.33, compared with r of

(Figures are correlations, decimal points omitted)

R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p \
.30). In view of the common professional opinion that clients over­
rate the degree of change they have undergone, this fact is of in­
terest. The possibility is also suggested that an individual may 
change so markedly over a period of eighteen months that at the 
conclusion his personality ii more dissimilar than similar to his 
personality at the outset.
One last comment on Figure 3 is in relation to the “ remembered 
self.” It will be noted that this remembered picture of the self cor­
relates positively with the diagnostic impression (r =  .30), thus tend­
ing to confirm the previous statement that it represents a more ac­
curate and less defensive picture than the client was able to give of 
herself at the time she entered therapy.
S u m m a r y  and C o n c l u sio n
In this paper I have endeavored to indicate at least a skeleton out­
line of the comprehensive investigation of psychotherapy now going 
forward at the University of Chicago. Several features have been 
mentioned.
First is the rejection of a global criterion in the study of therapy, 
and the adoption of specific operationally defined criteria of change, 
based upon detailed hypotheses growing out of a theory of the 
dynamics of therapy. The use of many specific criteria has enabled 
us to make scientific progress in determining the types of change 
which do and do not occur concomitant with client-centered 
therapy.
A second feature is a new approach to the hitherto unresolved 
problem of controls in studies of psychotherapy. The research de­
sign has included two control procedures, (1) a matched control 
group which accounts for the influence of time, repeated test-taking, 
and random variables, and (2) an own-control group in which each 
client in therapy is matched with himself during a period of no 
therapy, in order to account for the influence of personality varia­
bles and motivation. With this double-control design it has been 
possible to conclude that changes during therapy which are nor 
accounted for by the controlled variables, are due to the therapy 
itself.
Another feature selected for presentation was a sample of the

241
progress which has been made in carrying on rigorous objective 
investigation of subtle elements of the client’s subjective world. 
Evidence has been presented as to: the change in the self-concept of 
the client; the degree to which the perceived self becomes similar to 
the valued self; the extent to which the self as perceived becomes 
more comfortable and adjusted; and the degree to which the client’s 
perception of self becomes more congruent with a diagnostician’s 
perception of the client. These findings tend to confirm the theoreti­
cal formulations which have been made as to the place of the self- 
concept in the dynamic process of psychotherapy.
There are two conclusions which I would like to leave with you 
in closing. The first is that the research program I have described 
appears to make it quite clear that objective evidence, meeting the 
usual canons of rigorous scientific investigation, can be obtained 
as to the personality and behavioral changes brought about by 
psychotherapy, and has been obtained for one psychotherapeutic 
orientation. This means that in the future similar solid evidence 
can be obtained as to whether personality change occurs as a result 
of other psychotherapies.
The second conclusion is in my judgment even more significant. 
The methodological progress made in recent years means that the 
many subtleties of the therapeutic process are now wide open for 
research investigation. I have endeavored to illustrate this from the 
investigation of changes in the self-concept. Rut similar methods 
make it equally possible to study objcctivclv the changing relation­
ship between client and therapist, “ transference” and “counter- 
transference” attitudes, the changing source of the client’s value 
system, and the like. I believe it may be said that almost any 
theoretical construct which is thought to be related to personality 
change or to the process of psychotherapy, is now amenable to 
research investigation. This opens a new vista of scientific investi­
gation. The pursuit of this new path should throw much light on 
the dynamics of personality, particularly on the proccss of per­
sonality change in an interpersonal relationship.

Client-Centered Therapy 
in Its Context of Research *
H
ow could 1 viake clear,
 
to a European audience relatively un­
accustomed to the American tradition of empirical research 
in psychology, the methods, the findings, the significance, of re­
search in client-centered therapy? This was the task which was set 
for me by the fact that Dr. G. Marian Kinget and 1
 were writing a 
book on client-centered therapy to be published first in Flemish and 
then in French. Dr. Kinget presented the clinical principles of 
such therapy. I presented the central theories of client-centered 
therapy (almost identical with the English presentation, A Theory 
of Therapy, Personality and Interpersonal Relationships, in S. Koch 
{ed.) Psychology: A Study of a Science, vol. III. (New  York: 
McGraw-Hill, 1959), 184-256). 1 now wished to introduce them to 
the research in which we had engaged to confirm or disconfirm our 
theories. This chapter (slightly modified for this volume) is the 
result, and I hope it may have meaning for Americans as well as 
Europeans.

This chapter goes back to the earliest of our research efforts, 
around 1940, and concludes with a description of several of the un­
finished projects which are still challenging our best efforts in 
1961. Thus I have tried to present at least a small sampling of more 
than a score of years of research effort.

One of the most important characteristics of the client-centered 
orientation to therapy is that from the first it has not only stimulated 
research but has existed in a contcxt of research thinking. The 
number and variety of the completed studies is impressive. In 1953 
Seeman and Raskin described or mentioned nearly fifty research in­
vestigations having to do with client-centered therapy with adults, 
in their critical analysis of the trends and directions of such research 
(9). In 1957 Cartwright published an annotated bibliography of 
research and theory construction in client-centered therapy, and 
found it nccessary to include 122 references (4). He, like Seeman 
and Raskin, omitted all references having to do with research in 
play therapy and group therapy of a client-centered nature. There 
seems then no question but that the theory and practice of client- 
centered therapy have set in motion a surprising number of objective 
empirical investigations. It seems reasonable to ask ourselves why.
In the first place the theory of client-centered therapy has been 
seen from the first not as dogma or as truth but as a statement of 
hypotheses, as a tool for advancing our knowledge. It has been 
felt that a theory, or any segment of a theory, is useful only if it can 
be put to test. There has been a sense of commitment to the objective 
testing of each significant aspect of our hypotheses, believing that 
the only way in which knowledge can be separated from individual 
prejudice and wishful thinking is through objective investigation.

Client-Centered Therapy in Context of Research
245
T o he objective such investigation must be of the sort that another 
investigator collecting the data in the same wav and performing the 
same operations upon it, will discover the same or similar findings, 
and come to the same conclusions. In short we have believed from 
the first that the field of psychotherapy will be advanced bv the 
open, objective testing of all hypotheses in ways which are pub­
licly communicable and replicable.
A second reason for the stimulating effect of the client-centered 
approach upon research is the orienting attitude that scientific 
study can begin anywhere, at any level of crudity or refinement; 
that it is a direction, not a fixed degree of instrumentation. From 
this point of view, a recorded interview is a small beginning in 
scientific endeavor, because it involves greater objectification than 
the memory of an interview; a crude conceptualization of therapy, 
and crude instruments for measuring these concepts, arc more 
scientific than no such attempt. Thus individual research workers 
have felt that they could begin to move in a scientific direction in 
the areas of greatest interest to them. Out of this attitude has come 
a scries of instruments of increasing refinement for analyzing inter­
view' protocols, and significant beginnings have been made in meas­
uring such seemingly intangible constructs as the self-concept, and 
the psychological climate of a therapeutic relationship.
This leads me to what I believe to be the third major reason for 
the degree of success the theory has had in encouraging research. 
The constructs of the theory have, for the most part, been kept to 
those which can be given operational definition. This has seemed 
to meet a very pressing need for psychologists and others who have 
wished to advance knowledge in the field of personality, but who 
have been handicapped by theoretical constructs which cannot be 
defined operationally. Take for example the general phenomena 
encompassed in such terms as the self, the ego, the person. If a con­
struct is developed — as has been done by some theorizers — w
 hich 
includes those inner events not in the awareness of the individual as 
well as those in awareness, then there is no satisfactory way at the 
present time to give such a construct an operational definition. But 
by limiting the self-concept to events in awareness, the construct can 
be given increasingly refined operational definition through the

246
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
Q-technique, the analysis of interview protocols, etc., and thus a 
whole area of investigation is thrown open. In time the resulting 
studies may make it possible to give operational definition to the 
cluster of events not in awareness.
The use of operationally definable constructs has had one other 
effect. It has made completely unnecessary the use of “success” 
and “ failure” — two terms which have no scientific usefulness — as 
criteria in studies of therapy. Instead of thinking in these global 
and ill-defined terms research workers can make specific predictions 
in terms of operationally definable constructs, and these predictions 
can be confirmed or disconfirmed, quite apart from any value judg­
ment as to whether the change represents “success” or “ failure.” 
Thus one of the major barriers to scientific advance in this area has 
been removed.
Another reason for whatever effectiveness the system has had in 
mediating research, is that the constructs have generality. Because 
psychotherapy is such a microcosm of significant interpersonal re­
lationship, significant learning, and significant change in perception 
and in personality, the constructs developed to order the field have 
a high degree of pervasiveness. Such constructs as the self-concept, 
or the need for positive regard, or the conditions of personality 
change, all have application to a wide variety of human activities. 
Hence such constructs may be used to study areas as widely variant 
as industrial or military leadership, personality change in psychotic 
individuals, the psychological climate of a family or a classroom, or 
the inter-relation of psychological and physiological change.
One final fortunate circumstance deserves mention. Unlike psycho­
analysis, for example, client-centered therapy has always existed in 
the context of a university setting. This means a continual process of 
sifting and winnowing of the truth from the chaff, in a situation of 
fundamental personal security. It means being exposed to the friendly 
criticism of colleagues, in the same way that new views in chemistry 
or biology or genetics are subjected to critical scrutiny. Most of all 
it means that the theory and the technique are thrown open to the 
eager searching of younger minds. Graduate students question and 
probe; they suggest alternative formulations; they undertake empiri­

Client-Centered Therapy in Context of Research
247
cal studies to confirm or to disprove the various theoretical hypoth­
eses. This has helped greatly to keep the client-centered orienta­
tion an open and self-critical, rather than a dogmatic, point of view.
It is for reasons of this sort that client-centered therapy has built 
into itself from the first the process of change through research. 
From a limited view point largely centered on technique, with no 
empirical verification, it has grown to a ramifying theory of per­
sonality and interpersonal relations as well as of therapy, and it has 
collected around itself a considerable body of replicable empirical 
knowledge.
T h e E a r ly P eriod o f R f s i.arch
Objective investigations of psychotherapy do not have a long 
history. Up to 1940 there had been a few attempts to record 
therapeutic interviews electronically, but no research use had been 
made of such material. There had been no serious attempts to 
utilize the methods of science to measure the changes which were 
thought to occur in therapy. So we are speaking of a field w
 hich 
is still, relatively speaking, in its sw’addling clothes. But a beginning 
has been made.
Sometime in 1940 a group of us at Ohio State University success­
fully recorded a complete therapeutic interview. Our satisfaction 
was great, but it quickly faded. As we listened to tliis material, so 
formless, so complex, wre almost despaired of fulfilling our purpose 
of using it as the data for research investigations. It seemed almost 
impossible to reduce it to elements which could be handled ob­
jectively.
Yet progress was made. Enthusiasm and skill on the part of 
graduate students made up for the lack of funds and suitable equip­
ment. The raw data of therapy was transformed by ingenious and 
creative thinking into crude categories of therapist techniques and 
equally crude categories of client responses. Porter analyzed the 
therapist’s behavior in significant ways. Snyder analyzed clicnt re­
sponses in several cases, discovering some of the trends which 
existed. Others were equally creative, and little by little the pos­
sibility of research in this field became a reality.

These early studies were often unsophisticated, often faulty in 
research design, often based upon inadequate numbers, but their 
contribution as an opening wedge wras nonetheless great.
S o m e  11 LUSTRA! IVF. STUDIES
In order to give some feeling for the steadily growing stream of 
research several studies will be described in sufficient detail to give 
some notion of their methodology and their specific findings. The 
studies reported are not chosen because they arc especially out­
standing. They are representative of different trends in the research 
as it developed. They will be reported in chronological order.
T h e Locus o f E v a lu a tio n
In 1949 Raskin (5) completed a study concerned with the per­
ceived source of values, or the locus of the evaluating process. This 
started from the simple formulation that the task of the counselor 
was not to think for the client, or about the client, but with the 
client. In the first two the locus of evaluation clearly resides in the 
counselor, but in the last the counselor is endeavoring to think and 
empathize with the client within the latter’s own frame of refer­
ence, respecting the client's own valuing process.
The question Raskin raised was wT
hether the client’s perceived 
locus of evaluation changed during therapy. Putting it more specifi­
cally, is there a decrease in the degree to which his values and stand­
ards depend upon the judgments and expectations of others, and an 
increase in the extent to which his values and standards are based 
upon a reliance upon his own experience?
In order to study this objectively, Raskin undertook the follow­
ing steps.
1. 
Three judges working independently were asked to select, in 
several recorded interviews, those statements which had to do with 
the source of the client’s values and standards. It was found that 
there was more than 80 per cent agreement in the selection of such 
statements, indicating that the study was dealing with a discrimin­
a te  construct.

Client-Centered Therapy in Context of Research
249
2. Selecting 22 of these items to represent a wide range of source 
of values, Raskin gave these items to 20 judges, asking them to 
distribute these statements in four piles according to the continuum 
being studied, with equal-appearing intervals between the piles. 
Twelve of the items rated most consistently were used to form and 
illustrate a scale of locus of evaluation, with values from 1.0 to 4.0. 
Step 1
 represented an unqualified reliance on the evaluations made 
bv others. Step 2 included those instances in which there was a 
predominant concern with what others think, but some dissatis­
faction with this state of dependence. Step 3
 represented those ex­
pressions in which the individual showed as much respect for his 
own valuing process as for the values and expectations of others, 
and showed an awareness of the difference between self-evaluation 
and dependence on others’ values. Step 4 was reserved for those in­
stances in which there was clear evidence of reliance upon one’s own 
experience and judgment as the basic source of values.
An example illustrating stage 3
 may give a more vivid picture of 
this scale. The following client statement was rated as belonging in 
this step of the scale.
“So I’ve made a decision that I wonder if it is right. When you're 
in a family where your brother has gone to college and everybody 
has a good mind, I wonder if it is right to sec that I am as I am and
I can’t achieve such things. I’ve always tried to be what the others 
thought I should be, but now I’m wondering whether I shouldn’t 
just sec that I am what I am.” (6, p. 151).
3. Raskin now used this scale to rate each of 59 interviews in ten 
hricf but fully recorded cases which had been made the subject of 
other research investigations. After he had made these ratings, hut 
befcre analyzing them, he wished to determine the reliability of his 
judgments. Consequently he chose at random one item relating to 
locus of evaluation from each of the 59 interviews, and had these 
rated independently by another judge who knew nothing of the 
source of the items, or whether they camc from early or late in­
terviews. The correlation between the two sets of ratings was .91, 
a highly satisfactory reliability.
4. Having constructed a scale of equal-appearing intervals, and 
having demonstrated that it was a reliable instrument, Raskin was

R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o  t h e r a p y
now ready to determine whether there had been any shift in the 
locus of evaluation during therapy. The average score for the first 
interviews in the ten cases was 1.97, for the final interviews 2.73, 
a difference significant at the .01 level. Thus the theory of clicnt- 
centered therapy on this point was upheld. A further confirmation 
was available. These 10 cases had been studied in other objective 
wavs, so that there were objective criteria from other studies as to 
which cases were more, and which less successful. If one takes the 
five cases judged as more suiiessful, the shift in locus of evaluation 
in these cases is even sharper, the average for the first interviews 
being 2.12, and for the final interviews 3.34.
This study is, in a number of respects, typical of a large group 
of the research investigations which have been made. Starting with 
one of the hypotheses of client-centered theory, an instrument is 
devised to measure varying degrees of the construct in question. 
The instrument is then itself put to the test to determine whether 
it does in fact measure what it purports to measure, and whether 
any qualified person can use it and obtain the same or similar results. 
The instrument is then applied to the data of therapy in a way which 
can be shown to be unbiassed. (In Raskin’s case the checking of 
59 randomly selected items by another judge shows that bias, con­
scious or unconscious, did not enter appreciably into his ratings.) 
The data acquired from the use of the instrument can then be 
analyzed to determine whether it does or does not support the hy­
pothesis. In this case the hypothesis was upheld, confirming the 
theory that clients in client-centered therapy tend to decrease in 
the extent to which they rely for guidance upon the values and 
expectations of others, and that they tend to increase in reliance 
upon self-evaluations based upon their own experiences.
Although the number of cases studied is small, and the therapy 
very brief (as was characteristic of that earlier period) these are 
the only major flaws in this study. It is probable that if rcplicated 
on a larger number of longer cases the results would still be the 
same. It marks an intermediate level of research sophistication, some­
where between the very crude initial studies, and the more meticu­
lously designed recent studies.

T iie R e l a t io n  o f A u t o n o m ic  F u n c t io n  to T h er a py
Thetford undertook a study of quite a different sort, also com­
pleted in 1949 (11). His hypothesis went well beyond the theory 
of client-centered therapy, predicting physiological consequences 
which were consistent with the theory, but which had never been 
formulated.
Briefly his major hypothesis was that if therapy enables the indi­
vidual to reorient his pattern of life and to reduce the tension and 
anxiety he feels regarding his personal problems, then the reactions 
of his automatic nervous system in, for example, a situation of stress, 
should also be altered. Essentially he was hypothesizing that if a 
change in life pattern and in internal tension occurred in therapy, 
this should show up in organismic changes in autonomic function­
ing, an area over which the individual has no conscious control. 
Essentially he was asking, How deep are the changes wrought by 
client-centered therapy? Are they deep enough to affect the total 
organismic functioning of the individual?
Although his procedure was decidedly complex, it can be de­
scribed simply enough in its essentials. A therapy group of nineteen 
individuals was recruited, composed of clients coming to the Coun­
seling Center of the University of Chicago for personal help. They 
were invited to volunteer for a research in personality. Since all 
who were invited participated, except a few who could not arrange 
testing appointments, this was a representative group of student 
clients from the Center. 
Ten individuals went into individual 
therapy, three into individual and group therapy concurrently, and 
six into group therapy. A control group of seventeen individuals 
not in therapy was recruited, roughly similar in age and cduc.1tion.1
l 
status to the therapy group.
Every individual, whether therapy or control, went through the 
same experimental procedure. The most significant aspects were 
these. The individual was connected by suitable clcctrodcs to a 
polygraph which recorded his palmar skin conductance (G SR ), 
heart rate, and respiration. After a rest period to establish a base 
line, the individual was told that memory for digits was a good

252
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
index of intelligence, and thnr the experimenter wished to test him 
for this. The series of digits used was increased in length until the 
individual clearly failed. After a two minute rest, another series 
was used to bring another clear failure. After another rest, there 
was another frustrating failure. Since these were all students, the 
ego-involvement and the frustration were clearly real since the ex­
perience seemed to cast doubt on their intellectual ability. After 
another rest period the individual was released, but informed that 
he would be called back at a later time. At no time was there 
any hint that the experiment had anything to do with the individual’s 
therapy, and the testing was carried on in another building.
Following the completion of therapy the clients were recalled 
and went through the same experimental procedure — three episodes 
of frustration and recovery, with continuous autonomic measure­
ments being made. At matched time intervals, the controls were 
also recalled and put through an identical procedure.
Various physiological indices were computed for the therapy and 
control groups. The only significant differences between the groups 
were differences in the rapidity of recovery from frustration on the 
pre as compared with the post test. In general it may be said that the 
group which had therapy recovered from its frustration more 
quickly on the post-test than on the pre-test, while for the control 
group the results were the reverse. They recovered more slowly 
at the time of the second series of frustrations.
Let me make this more specific. The therapy group showed a 
change in the “ recovery quotient” based on the G SR  which was 
significant at the .02 level of confidence, and which was in the 
direction of more rapid recovery from frustration. The control 
group showed a change in the “ recovery quotient” which was 
significant at the 10 per cent level, and w’as in the direction of a 
slower recovery. In other words they were less able to cope with 
the frustration during the post-test than during the pre-test. An­
other G SR  measure, “per cent of recovery,” again showed the 
therapy group making a more rapid recovery at the second test, 
a change significant at the 5 per cent level, while the control group 
showed no change. As to cardiovascular activity the therapy group, 
on the average, showed less heart-rate variation at the time of the

253
post-test frustration, a changc significant at the 5 per cent level. 
The control group showed no changc. 
Other indices showed 
changes consistent with those mentioned, hut not as significant.
In general it may be said that the individuals who had experienced 
therapy developed a higher frustration threshold during their 
series of therapeutic contacts, and w ere able to recover their homeo­
static balance more rapidly following frustration. In the control 
group, on the other hand, there was a slight tendency toward a 
lower threshold for the second frustration, and a definitely less 
rapid recovery of homeostasis.
In simple terms, the significance of this study appears to be that 
after therapy the individual is able to meet, with more tolerance 
and less disturbance, situations of emotional stress and frustration; 
that this description holds, even though the particular frustration or 
stress was never considered in therapy; that the more effective 
meeting of frustration is not a surface phenomenon but is evident 
in autonomic reactions which the individual cannot consciously con­
trol and of which he is completely unaware.
This study of Thetford’s is characteristic of a number of the more 
pioneering and challenging of those which have been carried on. It 
went beyond clicnt-ccntercd theory as it had been formulated, and 
made a prediction consistent with the theory, and perhaps implicit 
in it, but well beyond the limits of the theory as it stood. Thus it 
predicted that if therapy enabled the individual better to handle stress 
at the psychological level, then this should be evident also in his 
autonomic functioning. The actual research was the testing of the 
correctness of the prediction. There is no doubt that the confirming 
effect on the theory is somewhat greater when rather remote pre­
dictions are tested and found to be correct.

A small study completed by Bergman (2) in 1950 is an example 
of the wav in which recorded interviews lend themselves to micro­
scopic studies of the therapeutic proccss. He wished to study the 
question, W hat is the nature of the relationship between the coun­
selor’s method or technique and the client’s response?
He chose to study all the instances in ten recorded cases (the

254
R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
same cases studied by Raskin and others) in which the client re­
quested an evaluation from the counselor. There were 246 such 
instances in the ten cases, in which the client requested some solu­
tion for his problems, or an evaluation of his adjustment or progress, 
or a confirmation of his own view, or a suggestion as to how he 
should proceed. Each of these instances was included in the study 
as a response unit. The response unit consisted of the total client 
statement which included the request, the immediately following 
response by the counselor, and the total client expression which 
followed the counselor statement.
Bergman found that the counselor responses to these requests 
could be categorized in the following ways.
1. An evaluation-based response. This might be an interpreta­
tion of the client material, agreement or disagreement with the 
client, or the giving of suggestions or information.
2. A “structuring” response. The counselor might explain his 
own role, or the way in which therapy operates.
3. A request for clarification. The counselor might indicate that 
the meaning of the client’s request is not clear to him.
4. A reflection of the context of the request. The counselor might 
respond by trying to understand the client material encompassing 
the request, but with no recognition of the request itself.
5. A reflection of the request. The counselor might endeavor to 
understand the client’s request, or the client’s request in a context of 
other feelings.
Bergman developed the following categories to contain the client 
expression subsequent to the counselor response.
1. Client again presents a request for evaluation, either a repetition 
of the same request or some enlargement or modification of it, or 
another request.
2. Client, whether accepting or rejecting the counselor response, 
abandons the attempt to explore his attitudes and problems (usually 
going off into other less relevant material.)
3. Client continues to explore his attitudes and problems.
4. Client verbalizes an understanding of relationships between 
feelings — expresses an insight.

255
Having checked the reliability of this categorization of both 
client and counselor material and having found it satisfactory, Berg­
man proceeded to analyze his data. He determined which categories 
occurred in conjunction w’ith other categories more frequently 
than could be accounted for by chance. Some of the significant 
findings are these.
There was essentially only a chance relationship between the 
categories of initial client request and subsequent client response. 
The same was true of initial client request and counselor response. 
Thus neither the counselor’s response nor the client’s subsequent ex­
pression seemed to be “caused” by the initial request.
On the other hand there was significant interaction found be­
tween the counselor’s response and the client’s subsequent expres­
sion.
1. Reflection of feeling by the counselor is followed, more often 
than would be expected by chance, by continued self-exploration 
or insight. This relationship is significant at the 1
 per cent level.
2. Counselor responses of types 1
 and 2 (evaluation-based and in­
terpretive responses or “structuring” responses) are followed, 
more often than would be expected by chance, by abandonment 
of self-exploration. This too is significant at the 1
 per cent level.
3. A counselor response requesting clarification tends to be followed 
by repetition of the request, or by a decrease in self-exploration 
and insight. These consequences are significant at the 1
 per cent 
and 5 per cent level, respectively.
Thus Bergman concludes that self-exploration and insight, posi­
tive aspects of the therapeutic process, appear to be furthered pri­
marily by responses which are “ reflections of feeling,” while evalua­
tive, interpretive, and “structuring” responses tend to foster client 
reactions which are negative for the process of therapy.
This study is an illustration of the wav in which, in a number of 
investigations, the verbal recording of therapeutic interviews lus 
been examined in a very minute and molecular way, in order to cast 
light upon some aspect of client-centered theory. In these studies 
the internal events of therapy have been examined objectively for 
the light they can throw upon the process.

Many investigations have been made of the changes in the client’s 
concept of self, a construct which is central to the client-centered 
theory of therapy and personality. One, a study by Butler and 
Haigh (3), will be briefly reported here.
A method which has frequently been used for this purpose is the 
Q-tcchniquc developed by Stephenson (10), and adapted for the 
study of the self. Since an instrument based on this technique is 
used in the Butler and Haigh study, it may be simply described be­
fore giving the findings of the study itself.
From a number of recorded counseling cases a large population of 
all the self-referent statements was gleaned. From this a selection 
of 100 statements was made, and the statements edited for the sake 
of clarity. The aim was to select the widest possible range of ways 
in which the individual could perceive himself. The list included 
such items as: “ I often feel resentful” ; “ I am sexually attractive” ; “ I 
really am disturbed” ; “I feel uncomfortable while talking with some­
one” ; “I feel relaxed and nothing really bothers me.”
In the Butler and Haigh study each person was asked to sort the 
cards containing the 100 items. First he was to “Sort these cards 
to describe yourself as you sec yourself today.” He was asked to 
sort the cards into nine piles, from those most unlike him, to those 
most like him. He was asked to place a ccrtain number in cach pile. 
(The numbers in each pile were 1, 4, 11, 21, 26, 21, 11, 4, 1, thus 
giving a forced and approximately normal, distribution.) 
When 
he had completed this sort he was asked to sort the cards once 
more “ to describe the person you would most like within yourself 
to be.” This meant that for each item one would obtain the in­
dividual’s self-perception, and also the value he attached to this 
characteristic.
It will be evident that the various sortings can be correlated. One 
can correlate the self pre-therapy with the self post-therapy, or 
the self with the ideal self, or the ideal self of one client with the 
ideal of another. High correlations indicate little discrepancy or 
change, low correlations the reverse. Study of the specific items 
which have been changed in their placement over therapy, for ex­
ample, gives a qualitative picture of the nature of the change. Be­

257
cause of the large population of items there is less loss of clinical 
richness in the statistical investigation. 
By and large this pro­
cedure has enabled investigators to turn subtle phenomenological 
perceptions into objective and manipulable data.
Let us turn to the use made of the Q-sort of self items in the 
Butler and Haigh study. The hypotheses were: (1) that client- 
centered therapy results in a decrease in the discrepancy between the 
pcrceivcd self and the valued self; and (2) that this decrease in dis­
crepancy will be more marked in clients who have been judged, on 
the basis of independent criteria, as having exhibited more move­
ment in therapy.
As part of a much more comprehensive total program of research 
(8) the Q-sort for self and for ideal self was given to 25 clients be­
fore therapy started, after the conclusion of therapy, and at a 
follow-up point six to twelve months after the conclusion of 
therapy. The same program of testing was followed in a non- 
thcrapv control group matched for age, sex and socio-economic 
status.
The findings are of interest. The self-ideal correlations in the 
client group before therapy ranged from —.47, a very marked dis­
crepancy between self and ideal, to .59, indicating that the self is 
quite highly valued as it is. The mean correlation at prc-thernpy 
was —.01. At the conclusion of therapy the mean was .34, and at 
the follow-up point it was .31. This represents a highly significant 
changc, supporting the hypothesis. It is of spccial interest that the 
correlation decreases only very slightly during the follow-up 
period. When attention is directed to the 17 cases who on the basis 
of counselor ratings and changc on the Thematic Apperception I
 cst 
had shown the most definite improvement in therapy, the changc is 
even sharper. Here the mean at pre-therapy was .02, at follow-up 
time, .44.
Fifteen members of the group constituted an “own-control” group. 
They had been tested when they first requested help, then asked to 
wait for 60 days before beginning therapy. They were re-tcstcd 
at the end of the 60-day period, as well as at the post-therapy and 
follow-up times. In this group of fifteen the self-ideal correlation at 
the first test wr
as —.01 and at the end of the 60-day period it was 
identical, -.0 1 . Thus the change which occurred during therapy

258
R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
is clearly associated 'with therapy, and does not result simply from 
the passage of time, or from a determination to obtain help.
The control group showed a very different picture from the 
therapy clients. The initial correlation of self and ideal was .58, 
and this did not change, being .59 at the follow-up point. Ob­
viously this group did not feel the tension felt by the client group, 
tended to value themselves, and did not change appreciably in this 
respect.
It is reasonable to conclude from this study that one of the 
changes associated with client-centered therapy is that self-per- 
ception is altered in a direction which makes the self more highly 
valued. This change is not a transient one, but persists after therapy. 
This decrease in internal tension is a highly significant one, but 
even at the end of therapy the self is somewhat less valued than is 
found to be the case in a non-therapy control group. (Therapy, 
in other words, has not brought about “perfect adjustment,” or a 
complete absence of tension.) It is also clear that the changes under 
discussion have not occurred simply as a result of the passage of 
time, nor as the result of a decision to seek help. They are definitely 
associated with the therapy.
This study is an example of many which have thrown light on 
the relationship of therapy to self-perception. From other studies 
(reported in Rogers and Dymond (8 )) we know that it is primarily 
the self-concept which changes in therapy, not the ideal self. The 
latter tends to change but slightly, and its change is in the direction 
of becoming a less demanding, or more achievable self. W e know 
that the self-picture emerging at the end of therapy is rated by 
clinicians (in a manner which excludes possible bias) as being bet­
ter adjusted. W e know that this emerging self has a greater degree 
of inner comfort, of self-understanding and self-acceptance, of self­
responsibility. W e know that this post-therapy self finds greater 
satisfaction and comfort in relationships with others. Thus bit by 
bit we have been able to add to our objective knowledge of the 
changes wrought by therapy in the client’s perceived self.

The studies described thus far in this chapter, and others which

many changcs. The individual makes choices and establishes values 
differently; he meets frustration with less prolonged physiological 
tension, he changes in the way he perceives himself and values him­
self. But this still leaves unanswered the question of practical con­
cern to the layman and to society, “Does the client’s everyday 
behavior change in such a way that the changcs can be observed, 
and is the nature of these changcs positive?” It was to try to 
answer this question that I, with the help of colleagues, undertook 
an investigation of changes in the maturity of the client’s behavior 
as related to therapy, a study published in 1954 (6).
The theory of client-centered therapy hypothesizes that the inner 
changcs taking place in therapy will causc the individual after 
therapy to behave in ways which are less defensive, more socialized, 
more acceptant of reality in himself and in his social environment, 
and which give evidence of a more socialized system of values. He 
will, in short, behave in ways which are regarded as more mature, 
and infantile ways of behaving will tend to decrease. The difficult 
question to which we addressed ourselves was whether an operational 
definition could be given to such a hypothesis in order to put it to 
empirical test.
There are few instruments which even purport to measure the 
quality of one’s everyday behavior. The best for our purposes was 
that developed by W illoughby a number of years ago, and termed 
the Emotional Maturity Scale. He constructed many items descrip­
tive of behavior and had them rated by 100 clinical workers — 
psychologists and psychiatrists — as to the degree of maturity they 
represented. On the basis of these judgments he sclccted 60 items 
to compose his Scale. The scores range from 1
 (most immature) 
to 9 (most mature). Several of the items, and their score values, 
are listed below to give the reader something of the flavor of the 
Scale.

1. S (subject) charactcristicallv appeals for help in the solution of 
his problems (Item 9).
3. When driving an automobile, S is unperturbed in ordin.iry siiui- 
tions but becomes angry with other drivers who impede his 
progress (Item 12).

5. 
On unmistakable demonstration of his inferiority in some respect, 
S is impressed but consoles himself by the contemplation of 
those activities in which he is superior (Item 45).
7. S organizes and orders his efforts in pursuing his objective, evi­
dently regarding systematic method as a means of achieving 
them (Item 17).
9. 
S welcomes legitimate opportunities for sexual expression; is not 
ashamed, fearful, or prcoccupicd with the topic (Item 53).
Having selected our instrument we were able to state our hy­
pothesis in operational form: Following the completion of clicnt- 
ccntcred therapy, the behavior of the client will be rated, by him­
self and by others who know him well, as being more mature, as 
evidenced by a higher score on the E-M  Scale.
The method of the study was necessarily complex, since accurate 
and reliable measurements of everyday behavior are difficult to 
obtain. The study was made as a part of a larger program of in­
vestigation of nearly thirty clicnts and an equal group of matched 
controls (8). The various steps were as follows.
1. The client, prior to therapy, was asked to make a self-evalua­
tion of his behavior on the E-M  Scale.
2. The client was asked for the names of two friends who knew 
him well and who would be willing to make ratings of him. The 
contact with these friends was by mail, and their ratings on the 
E-Al Scale were mailed dircctly to the Counseling Center.
3. Each friend was requested to rate, at the same time that he 
rated the client, one other person well known to him. The purpose 
of this was to determine the reliability of the friend’s ratings.
4. That half of the therapy group which had been designated as 
the own-control group, filled out the E-Al Scale when first re­
questing help and again, sixty days later, before therapy began. 
Ratings of the client by his two friends were also obtained at each 
of these times.
5. At the conclusion of therapy the client and his two friends 
were again requested for a rating on the E-.M Scale.
6. Six to twelve months following the conclusion of therapy rat­

261
ings of his behavior were again obtained from the client and his 
friends.
7. 
The members of the matched control group rated their behavior 
on the E-Al Scale at each of the points from which such ratings were 
obtained from the therapy group.
This design assembled a large body of data permitting analysis 
from various angles. Only the major findings will he reported 
here.
The E-M  Scale proved to have satisfactory reliability when used 
by any one rater, whether the client or an observcr-friend. I Iowever 
the agreement between the different raters was not close.
The individuals in the matched non-thcrapy conrrol group 
showed no significant change in their behavior ratings during any 
of the periods involved in the study.
The clients who were members of the own-control group showed 
no significant behavioral change during the sixty-day waiting period, 
whether judged by their own ratings or that of their friends.
There was no significant change in the observer’s ratings of the 
client’s behavior over the period of therapy or the combined period 
of therapy and follow-up. This was, of course, contrary to our 
hypothesis. It seemed desirable to determine whether this negative 
finding held for all clients regardless of the movement they appeared 
to make in therapy. Consequently the clients were divided into 
those rated by counselors as showing most, moderate, or least move­
ment in therapy.
It was found that for those rated as showing the most movement 
in therapy, the friend’s ratings of the client’s maturity of behavior 
increased significantly (5 per cent level). In the group showing 
moderate movement there was little change, and in the group 
showing least movement there was a negative change, in the direction 
of less mature behavior.
There was a definite and significant correlation between the 
therapist’s ratings of movement in therapy, and the friends’ obser­
vations of change in everyday behavior. This correlation is par­
ticularly interesting because the therapist’s judgment was based 
solely on client reactions in the therapy hour, with little or no knowl­

262
R l s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
edge of outside behavior. The friends’ ratings were based solely on 
outside observation, with no knowledge of what was going on in 
therapy.
In general these findings were paralleled by the clients’ ratings 
of their own behavior, with one interesting exception. Those clicnts 
who were rated by their counselors as showing movement in 
therapy rated themselves as showing an increase in maturity, the 
ratings being almost identical with those made by the observers. 
But those clients who were rated by the counselors as being least 
successful in therapy, and who were rated by observers as showing 
a deterioration in the maturity of behavior, described themselves in 
ways that gave them a sharp increase in maturity score both at the 
post-therapy and follow-up points. This seems to be clear evidence 
of a defensive self-rating when therapy has not gone well.
In general then the conclusion appears justified that where client- 
centered therapy has been judged to show progress or movement, 
there is a significant observable change in the client’s everyday be­
havior in the direction of greater maturity. Where the therapist 
feels that there has been little or no movement in therapy, then 
some deterioration in behavior is observed, in the direction of greater 
immaturity. This last finding is of particular interest because it is 
the first evidence that disintegrative consequences may accompany 
unsuccessful efforts to obtain help in a relationship with a client- 
centered therapist. While these negative consequences are not great, 
they nevertheless warrant further study.
This research illustrates the efforts made to investigate various 
behavioral results of psychotherapy. It also suggests some of the 
many difficulties involved in planning a sufficiently rigorous de­
sign such that one can be sure that (a) behavioral changes did in 
fact occur, and (b) that such changes are a consequence of the 
therapy and not of some other factor.
Having made this global study of everyday behavior changes, 
it seems possible that further research on this topic might better be 
carried on in the laboratory, where changes in problem-solving be­
havior. adaptive behavior, response to threat or frustration, etc., 
might be carried on under better-controlled conditions. The re­
ported study is however a pioneering one in indicating both that

succcssful therapy produces positive behavioral change, and that 
unsuccessful therapy can produce negative changes in behavior.

In a fresh series of cases, in which he knew that he would have 
various objective measures of degree of change, Barrett-Lennard 
gave his Relationship Inventory to each client after the fifth in­
terview. In order to give more of the flavor of his study, 1
 will 
give several of the items regarding each variable.
He was interested, for example, in measuring the extent to which 
the client felt himself to be empathically understood. So he included 
items such as these regarding the therapist, to be rated by the client 
on a six-point scale from very true to very strongly not true. It will 
be evident that these represent different degrees of empathic under­
standing.
He appreciates what my experience feels like to me.
He tries to see things thru my eyes.
Sometimes he thinks that I feel a certain way because he feels 
that way.
He understands what I say from a detached, objective point of 
view.
He understands my words but not the way I feel.
A second element he wished to measure was the level of regard, 
the degree of liking of the client by the therapist. T o measure this

there were items like the following, each one again rated from 
strongly true, to strongly not true.
I T
e cares about me.
He is interested in me.
He is curious about “ what makes me tick,” but not really inter­
ested in me as a person.
He is indifferent to me.
He disapproves of me.
T o  measure the unconditionality of the regard, the extent to 
which there were “ no strings attached” to the counselor’s liking, 
items of this sort were included.
Whether I am expressing “ good” feelings or “bad” ones seems 
to make no difference to the way he feels toward me.
Sometimes he responds to me in a more positive and friendly 
way than he does at other times.
II is interest in me depends on what I am talking to him about.
In order to measure the congruence or genuineness of the therapist 
in the relationship, items of this sort were used.
He behaves just the wax- that he w, in our relationship.
He pretends that he likes me or understands me more than he 
really does.
There are times when his outward response is quite different 
from his inner reaction to me.
He is playing a role with me.
Barrett-Lennard also wished to measure another variable which 
he regarded as important— the counselor’s psychological avail­
ability. or willingness to be known. T o measure this, items of this 
sort were used.
He will freely tell me his own thoughts and feelings, when I 
want to know them.
He is uncomfortable when I ask him something about himself.
He is unwilling to tell me how he feels about me.

Some of his findings are of interest. The more experienced of his 
therapists were perceived as having more of the first four qualities 
than the less experienced therapists. In “ willingness to he known,” 
however, the reverse was true.
In the more disturbed clients in his sample, the first four measures 
all correlated significantly with the degree of personality change as 
objectively measured, and with the degree of change as rated by the 
therapist. Empathic understanding was most significantly associated 
with change, but genuineness, level of regard, and unconditionally 
of regard were also associated with successful therapy. Willingness 
to be known was not significantly associated.
Thus we can say, with some assurance, that a relationship charac­
terized by a high degree of congruence or genuineness in the thera­
pist; by a sensitive and accurate empathy on the part of the therapist; 
by a high degree of regard, respect, liking for the client by the 
therapist; and by an absence of conditionality in this regard, will 
have a high probability of being an effective therapeutic relationship. 
These qualities appear to be primary change-producing influences 
on personality and behavior. It seems clear from this and other 
studies that these qualities can be measured or observed in small 
samples of the interaction, relatively early in the relationship, and 
yet can predict the outcome of that relationship.
This study is an example of recent work which puts to test c\cr 
more subtle aspects of the theory of clicnt-ccntered therapy. It is 
to be noted that this study docs not deal with matters of technique 
or conceptualizations. It cuts through to intangible attitudin.il and 
experiential qualities. Research in psychotherapy has, in my judg­
ment, come a long way to be able to investigate such intangibles. 
The positive evidence in regard to four ot the variables, and the Lick 
of positive evidence in regard to the fifth variable, is to me an in­
dication that helpful and discriminative findings may conic from 
studies carried on at this level.
It is of more than passing interest that the relationship qualities 
associated with progress in therapy are all attitudinal qualities. W
 hile 
it mav be that degree of professional knowledge, or skills and tech­
niques will also be found to be associated with change, this study 
raises the challenging possibility that certain attitudinal and ex peri-

266
R e s e a r c h  i n  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
ential qualities by themselves, regardless of intellectual knowledge 
or medical or psychological training, may be sufficient to stimulate 
a positive therapeutic process.
This investigation is a pioneering one in still another respect. It 
is one of the first explicitly designed to study the causative or change- 
producing elements of psychotherapy. In this respect theory has 
advanced sufficiently, and methodological sophistication as well, that 
we may look forward to an increasing number of investigations into 
the dynamics of personality changc. W e may in time be able to dis­
tinguish and measure the conditions which cause and produce con­
structive change in personality and behavior.

Investigations relating to psychotherapy arc burgeoning in the 
United States. Even the psychoanalytic group is embarking on 
several objective studies of the process of analytic therapy. 
It 
would be quite impossible to review what is going on today, since 
the picture is so complex, and so rapidly changing. I shall limit my­
self to very brief sketches of several research projects and programs 
related to client-centered therapy of which I have personal knowl­
edge.
A study is going on at the University of Chicago under the direc­
tion of Dr. John Shlicn to investigate the changes which occur in 
brief time-limited therapy, and to compare these changes with those 
which occur in the usual unlimited therapy. Clients are offered a 
definite number of interviews (twenty in most instances, forty in 
some) and therapy is concluded at the end of this time. Both the 
way in which individuals are able to use time, and the possibility of 
shortening the therapy period, arc of interest to the investigators. 
This program should be completed in the not-too-distant future.
A study which is closely related is an investigation of short-term 
Adlerian therapy. W ith the active cooperation of Dr. Rudolph 
Dreikurs and his colleagues, Dr. Shlicn is carrying on a study of 
Adlerian therapy exactly parallel to the above. If all goes well with 
the program it will mean that a direct comparison can be made of

two sharply divergent therapies — Adlerian and client-centered — 
in which the same pre-tests and post-tests will have been adminis­
tered, the therapy will be identical in length, and all interviews 
will have been recorded. This will indeed be a milestone, and should 
greatly expand our knowledge of the common and divergent ele­
ments in different forms of therapy.
Another study at the University of Chicago is being carried on by 
Dr. Desmond Cartwright, Donald Fiske, William Kirtncr, and others. 
It is attempting to investigate, on a very broad basis indeed, a great 
many of the factors which may be associated with therapeutic 
change. It is casting a broad net to investigate many elements not 
previously considered which may be related to progress or lack of 
progress in therapy.
At the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Robert Rocssler, Dr. Norman 
Greenfield, Dr. Jerome Berlin and I have embarked upon a ramified 
group of studies which it is hoped will, among other things, throw 
light on the autonomic and physiological correlates of client- 
centered therapy. In one portion of the investigation continuous 
recordings of G SR, skin temperature, and heart rate are being made 
on clients during the therapy hour. The comparison of these with 
the recorded interviews will perhaps give more information as to 
the fundamental physiological-psychological nature of the process 
of personality change.
A smaller project in which several individuals are at work involves 
the objective study of the process of psychotherapy. In a recent 
paper (7 )1  formulated a theoretical picture, based upon observation, 
of the irregularly sequential stages in the process of psychotherapy. 
We are currently at work translating this theoretical description 
into an operational scale which may be used to study recorded 
therapeutic interviews. Currently studies having to do with the re­
liability and validity of this scale arc being carried on.
Still another program at the University of Wisconsin in which Dr. 
Eugene Gendlin and I are the principal investigators, concerns it­
self with a comparison of the process of psychotherapy in schizo­
phrenic patients (both chronic and acute) with that in normal in­
dividuals. Each therapist in the study will take on three clients at 
a time, matched for age, sex, socio-educational status — one chronic

268
R e s e a r c h  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
schizophrenic, one acute schizophrenic, and one person of “ normal” 
adjustment from the community. With a variety of pre-tests and 
post-tests, and a recording of all interview s, it is hoped that this study 
will have many findings of interest. It pushes the testing of client- 
centered hypotheses into a new field, that of the hospitalized psy­
chotic person. Part of the fundamental In pothesis of the study is 
that given the necessary conditions of therapy (somewhat as de­
fined in the Barrett-Lennard study) the process of change will be 
found to be the same in the schizophrenic person as in the normal.
Perhaps these brief descriptions are sufficient to indicate that the 
body of objective investigation stimulated by the practice and 
theory of client-centered therapy is continuing to grow and ramify.
T h e  M e a n in g  o f  R e s e a r c h  f o r  t h e  F u t u r e
In concluding this chapter I would like to comment on the ques­
tion “Where does this lead? T o  what end is all this research?”
Its major significance, it seems to me, is that a growing body of 
objectively verified knowledge of psychotherapy will bring about 
the gradual demise of “schools” of psychotherapy, including this 
one. As solid knowledge increases as to the conditions which facili­
tate therapeutic change, the nature of the therapeutic process, the 
conditions which block or inhibit therapy, the characteristic out­
comes of therapy in terms of personality or behavioral change, then 
there will be less and less emphasis upon dogmatic and purely theo­
retical formulations. Differences of opinion, different procedures in 
therapy, different judgments as to outcome, will be put to empirical 
test rather than being simply a matter of debate or argument.
In mcdicine today we do not find a “ penicillin school of treat­
ment” versus some other school of treatment. There are differences 
of judgment and opinion, to be sure, but there is confidence that 
these will be resolved in the foreseeable future by carefully designed 
research. Just so I believe will psychotherapy turn increasingly to 
the facts rather than to dogma as an arbiter of differences.
Out of this should grow an increasingly effective, and continually 
changing psychotherapy which will neither have nor need any

Client-Centered Therapy in Context of Research
269
specific label. It will have incorporated whatever is factually verified 
from any and every therapeutic orientation.
Perhaps I should close here, but I would like to say one further 
word to those who may abhor research in such a delicately personal 
and intangible field as psychotherapy. They may feel that to subject 
such an intimate relationship to objective scrutiny is somehow to de­
personalize it, to rob it of its most essential qualities, to reduce it to 
a cold system of facts. 1
 would simply like to point out that to date 
this has not been its effect. Rather the contrary has been true. The 
more extensive the research the more it has become evident that the 
significant changes in the client have to do with very subtle and 
subjective experiences — inner choices, greater oneness within the 
whole person, a different feeling about one’s self. And in the thera­
pist some of the recent studies suggest that a warmly human and 
genuine therapist, interested only in understanding the momcnt-by- 
moment feelings of this person who is coming into being in the re­
lationship with him, is the most effective therapist. Certainly there 
is nothing to indicate that the coldly intellectual analytical factually- 
minded therapist is effective. It seems to be one of the paradoxes of 
psychotherapy that to advance in our understanding of the field 
the individual must be willing to put his most passionate beliefs and 
firm convictions to the impersonal test of empirical research; but to 
be effective as a therapist, he must use this knowledge only to enrich 
and enlarge his subjective self, and must be that self, freely and with­
out fear, in his relationship to his client.

Personal Thoughts on 
Teaching and Learning
T
his is the shortest chapter in the hook hut if my experience with 
it is any criterion, it is also the most explosive. It has a (to me) 
mimsing history.
/ had agreed, months in advance, to meet 'with a conference 
orga?iized by Harvard University on “ Classroom Approaches to 
Influencing Human B e h a v io r I  was requested to put on a demon­
stration of “ student-centered teaching” — teaching based upon 
therapeutic principles as 1 had been endeavoring to apply them in 
education. I felt that to use two hours with a sophisticated group 
to try help to them formulate their own purposes, and to respond 
to their feelings as they did so, would be highly artificial and un­
satisfactory. I did not know what I would do or present.
At this juncture I took off for Mexico on one of our winter- 
quarter trips, did some painting, writing, and photography. and im­
mersed inyself in the writings of Sdren Kierkegaard. I am sure ihat 
his honest willingness to call a spade a spade influenced me more than 
I realized.
As the time came near to return I had to face up to my obligation. 
1 recalled that I had sometimes been able to initiate very meaningful 
class discussions by expressing some highly personal opinion of my 
own, and then endeavoring to understand and accept the often very 
273

274
W
h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  L iv in g ?
divergent reactions and feelings of the students. This seemed a sen­
sible way of handling my Harvard assignment.
So I sat down to write, as honestly as I could, what my experi­
ences had been with teaching, as this term is defined in the diction­
aries, and likewise my experience with learning. I was far away from 
psychologists, educators, cautious colleagues. I s'miply put down 
what I felt, with assurance that if I had not got it correctly, the dis­
cussion would help to set me on the right track.
/ may have been naive, but I did not consider the material inflam­
matory. After all the conference members were knowledgeable, self- 
critical teachers, whose main common bond was an interest in the 
discussion method in the classroom.
I met with the conference, I presented my views as written out 
below, taking only a very few moments, and threw the meeting 
open for discussion. I was hoping for a response, but I did not ex­
pect the tumult which followed. Feelings ran high. It seemed I 
was threatening their jobs, I was obviously saying things I didn't 
mean, etc., etc. And occasionally a quiet voice of appreciation arose 
from a teacher who had felt these things but never dared to say 
them.
I daresay that not one member of the group remembered that this 
meeting was billed as a demonstration of student-centered teaching. 
But I hope that in looking back each realized that he had lived an ex­
perience of student-centered teaching. I refused to defend myself 
by replying to the questions and attacks which came from every 
quarter. I endeavored to accept and empathize with the indigna­
tion, the frustration, the criticisms which they felt. I pointed out 
that I had merely expressed some very personal views of my own. I 
had not asked nor expected others to agree. After much storm, mem­
bers of the group began expressing, more and more frankly, their 
own significant feelings about teaching — often feelings divergent 
from mine, often feelings divergent from each other. It was a very 
thought-provoking session. I question whether any participant in 
that session has ever forgotten it.
The most meaningful comment came from one of the conference 
members the next morning as I was preparing to leave the city. All 
he said was, “ You kept more people awake last night!*9

1 took no steps to have this small fragment published. My views 
on psychotherapy had already made me a “controversial figure” 
among psychologists and psychiatrists. 1
 had no desire to add cditca- 
cators to the list. The statement was widely duplicated however by 
members of the conference and several years later two journals re­
quested permission to publish it.
After this lengthy historical build-up, you may find the statement 
itself a let-down. Personally 1 have never felt it to be incendiary. 
It still expresses some of my deepest views in the field of education.

m y  o w n  ideas.
I find it a very troubling thing to think, particularly when I think 
about my own experiences and try to extract from those experiences 
the meaning that seems genuinely inherent in them. At first such 
thinking is vary satisfying, because it seems to discover sense and 
pattern in a whole host of discrete events. But then it very often 
becomes dismaying, because I realize how ridiculous these thoughts, 
which have much value to me, would seem to most people. My im­
pression is that if I try to find the meaning of my own experience it 
leads me, nearly always, in directions regarded as absurd.
So in the next three or four minutes, I will try to digest some of 
the meanings w hich have com e to me from m y classroom experience 
and the experience I have had in individual and group therapy. They 
arc in no w ay intended as conclusions for some one else, or a guide 
to what others should do or be. T h ey are the very tentative mean­
ings, as of April 1952, w hich m y experience has had for me, and 
some o f the bothersom e questions w hich their absurdity raises. I
 will 
put each idea or meaning in a separate lettered paragraph, not be­
cause they are in any particular logical order, but because each mean­
ing is separately important to me.

conference. My experience has been that I cannot teach another 
person how to teach. T o attempt it is for me, in the long run, futile.
b. It seems to vie that anything that can be taught to another is 
relatively inconsequential, and has little or no significant influence 
on behavior. That sounds so ridiculous I can’t help but question it 
at the same time that I present it.
c. I realize increasingly that I am only interested in learnings 
which signflcantly influence behavior. Quite possibly this is simply 
a personal idiosyncrasy.
d. 1
 have come to feel that the only learning which significantly 
influences behavior is self-discovered, self-appropriated learning.
e. Such self-discovered learning, truth that has been personally 
appropriated and assimilated in experience, cannot be directly com- 
municated to another. As soon as an individual tries to communicate 
such experience dircctly, often with a quite natural enthusiasm, it be­
comes teaching, and its results are inconsequential. It was some relief 
recently to discover that S0ren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, 
had found this too, in his own experience, and stated it very clearly 
a century ago. It made it seem less absurd.
f. As a consequence of the above, / realize that I have lost interest 
in being a teacher.
g. When I try to teach, as I do sometimes, I ain appalled by the 
results, which seem a little more than inconsequential, because some­
times the teaching appears to succeed. When this happens I find that 
the results are damaging. It seems to cause the individual to distrust 
his own experience, and to stifle significant learning. Hence I have 
come to feel that the outcomes of teaching are either unimportant or 
hurtful.
h. When I look back at the results of my past teaching, the real 
results seem the same — either damage was done, or nothing signif­
icant occurred. This is frankly troubling.
i. As a consequence, I realize that I a?jj only interested in being ,i 
learner, preferably learning things that matter, that have some sig- 
viflcant influence on my own behavior.
j. / find it very rewarding to learn, in groups, in relationships with 
one person as in therapy, or by myself.
k. I find that one of the best, but most difficult ways for me to

111
learn is to drop my own defensiveness, at least temporarily, and to 
try to understand the way in which his experience seems and feels 
to the other person.
1
. 
/ find that another way of learning for me is to state iny oven 
uncertainties, to try to clarify my puzzlements, and thus get closer 
to the meaning that my experience actually seems to have.
m. This whole train of experiencing, and the meanings that I have 
thus far discovered in it, seem to have launched me on a process 
which is both fascinating and at times a little frightening. It seems to 
mean letting my experience carry me on, in a direction •which appears 
to be forward, toward goals that I can but dimly define, as I try to 
understand at least the current meaning of that experience. The sen­
sation is that of floating with a complex stream of experience, with 
the fascinating possibility of trying to comprehend its ever chang­
ing complexity.
I am almost afraid I may seem to have gotten away from any dis­
cussion of learning, as well as teaching. Let me again introduce a 
practical note by saying that by themselves these interpretations of 
my own experience may sound queer and aberrant, but not particu­
larly shocking. It is when I realize the implications that I shudder a 
hit at the distance I have come from the commonscnse world that 
everyone knows is right. I can best illustrate that by saying that if 
the experiences of others had been the same as mine, and if they had 
discovered similar meanings in it, many consequences would be im­
plied.
a. Such experience would imply that wc would do away with 
teaching. People w ould get together if they w
 ished to learn.
b. We would do away with examinations. They measure only 
the inconsequential type of learning.
c. The implication w ould be that wc would do away w
 ith grades 
and credits for the same reason.
d. We would do away with degrees as a measure of compctcncc 
partly for the same reason. Another reason is that a degree marks 
an end or a conclusion of something, and a learner is only interested 
in the continuing proccss of learning.
e. It wrould imply doing away w'ith the exposition of conclusions,

278
W
h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r L iv in g ?
for we would realize that no one learns significantly from conclu­
sions.
I think I had better stop there. I do not want to become too fan­
tastic. I want to know primarily whether anything in my inward 
thinking as I have tried to describe it, speaks to anything in your ex­
perience of the classroom as you have lived it, and if so, what the 
meanings are that exist for you in your experience.

Significant Learning: 
In Therapy and in Education
G
oddard College, at Plainfield, Vermont,
 
is a small experimental 
college 'which in addition to its efforts on behalf of its students, 
frequently organizes conferences and workshops for educators, 
•where they may deal with significant problems. I was asked to lead 
such a workshop in February 1958, on “ The Implications of Psycho­
therapy for E d u c a tio n T e a c h e rs and educational administrators 
from the eastern half of the country, aiid especially from the New 
England area, found their way through the thick snowdrifts to spend 
three concentrated days together.
I decided to try to reformulate my views on teaching and learning 
for this conference, hopefully in a way which would be less dis­
turbing than the statement in the preceding chaptcr, yet without 
dodging the radical implications of a therapeutic approach. This 
paper is the result. For those who are fajniliar with Part II of this 
book the sections on uThe Conditions of Learning in Psychotherapy"1
 
and “ The Process of Learning in Therapy” will be redundant and 
may be skipped, since they are merely a restatement of the basic con­
ditions for therapy, as described earlier.
To me this is the most satisfying formulation I have achieved of 
the meaning of the hypotheses of client-centered therapy in the field 
of education.

P
r f .s f .n t e d  h f .r e  is a  T H K sis, a point of view, regarding the impli­
cations which psychotherapy has for education. It is a stand 
which I take tentatively, and with some hesitation. I have many un­
answered questions about this thesis. But it has, I think, some clarity 
in it, and hence it may provide a starting point from which clear dif­
ferences can emerge.
S ig n if ic a n t  L e a r n in g  in  P s y c h o t h e r a p y
Let me begin by saying that my long experience as a therapist 
convinces me that significant learning is facilitated in psychotherapy, 
and occurs in that relationship. By significant learning I mean learn­
ing which is more than an accumulation of facts. It is learning 
which makes a difference — in the individual’s behavior, in the 
course of action he chooses in the future, in his attitudes and in his 
personality. It is a pervasive learning which is not just an accretion of 
knowledge, but which interpenetrates with every portion of his ex­
istence.
N ow  it is not only my subjective feeling that such learning takes 
place. This feeling is substantiated by research. In client-centered 
therapy, the orientation with which I am most familiar, and in which 
the most research has been done, we know that exposure to such 
therapy produces learnings, or changes, of these sorts:
The person comes see himself differently.
He accepts himself and his feelings more fully.
He becomes more self-confident and self-directing.
He becomes more the person he would like to be.
He becomes more flexible, less rigid, in his perceptions.
He adopts more realistic goals for himself.
He behaves in a more mature fashion.
He changes his maladjustive behaviors, even such a long-estab­
lished one as chronic alcoholism.
He becomes more acceptant of others.

Significant Learning: In Therapy ana in Education
281
He becomes more open to the evidence, both to what is going on 
outside of himself, and to what is going on inside of himself.
He changes in his basic personality characteristics, in constructs e 
ways.*
I think perhaps this is sufficient to indicate that these are learn­
ings which are significant, which do m»ke a difference.
S i g n if ic a n t  L e a r n in g  in  E d u c a t io n
I believe I am accurate in saying that educators too are interested 
in learnings which make a difference. Simple knowledge of facts has 
its value. T o know who won the battle of Poltava, or when the 
umpteenth opus of Mozart was first performed, may win $64,000 or 
some other sum for the possessor of this information, but I believe 
educators in general arc a little embarrassed by the assumption that 
the acquisition of such knowledge constitutes education. Speaking 
of this reminds me of a forceful statement made by a professor of 
agronomy in my freshman year in college. Whatever knowledge 
I gained in his course has departed completely, but I remember how, 
with W orld W ar I as his background, he was comparing factual 
knowledge with ammunition. He wound up his little discourse with 
the exhortation, “ Don’t be a damned ammunition wagon; be a rifle!” 
I believe most educators would share this sentiment that knowledge 
exists primarily for use.
T o the extent then that educators arc interested in learnings m hich 
are functional, which make a difference, which pervade the person 
and his actions, then they might well look to the field of psycho­
therapy for leads or ideas. Some adaptation for education of the 
learning process which takes place in psychotherapy seems like a 
promising possibility.
T h e  C o n d it io n s o f  L e a r n in g  in  P s y c h o ih f k a p v
Let us then see what is involved, essentially, in making possible the 
learning which occurs in therapy. 1

h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r L iv in g ?
as I can, the conditions which seem to be present when this phenome­
non occurs.
F acin g a P r o b l e m
The clicnt is, first of all, up against a situation which he perceivcs 
as a serious and meaningful problem. It may be that he finds himself 
behaving in ways in which he cannot control, or he is overwhelmed 
by confusions and conflicts, or his marriage is going on the rocks, or 
he finds himself unhappy in his work. He is, in short, faced with a 
problem w'ith which he has tried to cope, and found himself unsuc­
cessful. He is therefore eager to learn, even though at the same time 
he is frightened that what he discovers in himself may be disturbing. 
Thus one of the conditions nearly always present is an uncertain and 
ambivalent desire to learn or to change, growing out of a perceived 
difficulty in meeting life.
W hat are the conditions which this individual meets when he 
comes to a therapist? I have recently formulated a theoretical pic­
ture of the necessary and sufficient conditions which the therapist 
provides, if constructive change or significant learning is to occur 
(8). This theory is currently being tested in several of its aspects 
by empirical research, but it must still be regarded as theory based 
upon clinical experience rather than proven fact. Let me describe 
briefly the conditions which it seems essential that the therapist 
should provide.
C o n g r u e n c e
If therapy is to occur, it seems necessary that the therapist be, in 
the relationship, a unified, or integrated, or congruent person. What 
I mean is that within the relationship he is exactly what he is — not 
a fagade, or a role, or a pretense. I have used the term “ congruence” 
to refer to this accurate matching of experience with awareness. It 
is when the therapist is fully and accurately aware of what he is ex­
periencing at this moment in the relationship, that he is fully con­
gruent. Unless this congruence is present to a considerable degree it 
is unlikely that significant learning can occur.
Though this concept of congruence is actually a complex one, I 
believe all of us recognize it in an intuitive and commonsense way in 
individuals with whom we deal. W ith one individual we recognize

Significant Learning: In Therapy and in Education
283
that he not only means exactly what he says, but that his deepest 
feelings also match what he is expressing. Thus whether he is angry 
or affectionate or ashamed or enthusiastic, we sense that lie is the 
same at all levels — in what he is experiencing at an organismic level, 
in his awareness at the conscious level, and in his words and commu­
nications. W e furthermore recognize that he is acceptant of his 
immediate feelings. W e say of such a person that we know “exactly 
where he stands.” We tend to feel comfortable and secure in such 
a relationship. With another person we recognize that what he is 
saying is almost certainly a front or a fagade. We wonder what he 
really feels, what he is really experiencing, behind this facade. We 
may also wonder if he knows what he really feels, recognizing that 
he may be quite unaware of the feelings he is actually experiencing. 
With such a person we tend to be cautious and wary. It is not the 
kind of relationship in which defenses can be dropped or in which 
significant learning and change can occur.
Thus this second condition for therapy is that the therapist is 
characterized by a considerable degree of congruence in the rela­
tionship. He is freely, deeply, and acceptantly himself, with his ac­
tual experience of his feelings and reactions matched by an accurate 
awareness of these feelings and reactions as they occur and as they 
change.
U n c o n d itio n a l P o sit iv e R egard
A third condition is that the therapist experiences a warm caring 
for the client — a caring which is not possessive, which demands no 
personal gratification. It is an atmosphere which simply demonstrates 
“I care” ; not “ I care for you if you behave thus and so.” Standal 
(11) has termed this attitude “unconditional positive regard,” since 
it has no conditions of worth attached to it. I have often used the 
term “ acceptance” to describe this aspect of the therapeutic climate. 
It involves as much feeling of acceptance for the client’s expression 
of negative, “bad,” painful, fearful, and abnormal feelings as for his 
expression of “ good,” positive, mature, confident and social fe e l­
ings. It involves an acceptance of and a caring for the clicnt as a 
separate person, with permission for him to have his own feelings 
and experiences, and to find his own meanings in them. 
To the 
degree that the therapist can provide this safety-creating climate of

284
W
h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  L iv in g ?
unconditional positive regard, significant learning is likely to take 
place.
A n E m p a t h ic  U n d er sta n d in g 
The fourth condition for therapy is that the therapist is experienc­
ing an accurate, empathic understanding of the client’s world as 
seen from the inside. T o  sense the client’s private world as if it were 
your own, but without ever losing the “as if” quality — this is 
empathy, and this seems essential to therapy. T o sense the client’s 
anger, fear, or confusion as if it were your own, yet without your 
own anger, fear, or confusion getting bound up in it, is the condi­
tion we are endeavoring to describe. When the client’s world is this 
clear to the therapist, and he moves about in it freely, then he can 
both communicate his understanding of what is clearly known to 
the client and can also voice meanings in the client’s experience of 
which the client is scarcely aware. That such penetrating empathy 
is important for therapy is indicated by Fiedler’s research in which 
items such as the following placed high in the description of rela­
tionships created by experienced therapists:
The therapist is well able to understand the patient’s feelings.
The therapist is never in any doubt about what the patient means. 
The therapist’s remarks fit in just right with the patient’s mood 
and content.
The therapist’s tone of voice conveys the complete ability to 
share the patient’s feelings. (3)
F if t h  C o nd itio n
A fifth condition for significant learning in therapy is that the 
client should experience or perceive something of the therapist’s 
congruence, acceptance, and empathy. It is not enough that these 
conditions exist in the therapist. They must, to some degree, have 
been successfully communicated to the client.
T h e  P r o c e s s o f L e a r n in g  in  T h e r a p y
It has been our experience that when these five conditions exist, 
a proccss of change inevitably occurs. The client’s rigid perceptions

Significant Learning: In Therapy and in Education
285
of himself and of others loosen and become open to reality. The 
rigid ways in which he has construed the meaning of his experience 
are looked at, and he finds himself questioning many of the “ facts” 
of his life, discovering that they are only “facts” because he has 
regarded them so. He discovers feelings of which he has hcen 
unaware, and experiences them, often vividly, in the therapeutic re­
lationship. Thus he learns to be more open to all of his experience
— the evidence within himself as well as the evidence without. lie 
learns to be more of his experience — to be the feelings of which 
he has been frightened as well as the feelings he has regarded as more 
acceptable. He becomes a more fluid, changing, learning person.
T h e M a in sp r in g o f C h a ng e
In this process it is not necessary for the therapist to “motivate” 
the client or to supply the energy which brings about the change. 
Nor, in some sense, is the motivation supplied by the client, at least 
in any conscious way. Let us say rather that the motivation for learn­
ing and change springs from the self-actualizing tendency of life 
itself, the tendency for the organism to flow into all the differen­
tiated channels of potential development, insofar as these arc ex­
perienced as enhancing.
I could go on at very considerable length on this, but it is not 
my purpose to focus on the process of therapy and the learnings 
which take place, nor on the motivation for these learnings, but 
rather on the conditions which make them possible. So 1
 will simply 
conclude this description of therapy by saying that it is a type of 
significant learning which takes place when five conditions arc 
met:
When the client perceives himself as faced by a serious and mean­
ingful problem;
When the therapist is a congruent person in the relationship, able 
to be the person he is;
When the therapist feels an unconditional positive regard for the 
client;
When the therapist experiences an accurate cmpathic understand­
ing of the client’s private world, and communicates this;
When the client to some degree experiences the therapist s con­
gruence, acceptance, and empathy.

h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  L iv in g ?
I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  E d u c a t io n
W hat do these conditions mean if applied to education? Un­
doubtedly the teacher will be able to give a better answer than I out 
of his own experience, but I will at least suggest some of the impli­
cations.
C o n ta c t w it h  P r o b l e m s
In the first place it means that significant learning occurs more 
readily in relation to situations perceived as problems. I believe I 
have observed evidence to support this. In my own varying attempts 
to conduct courses and groups in ways consistent with my thera­
peutic experience, I have found such an approach more effective, I 
believe, in workshops than in regular courses, in extension courses 
than in campus courses. Individuals who come to workshops or 
extension courses are those who are in contact with problems which 
they recognize as problems. The student in the regular university 
course, and particularly in the required course, is apt to view the 
course as an experience in which he expects to remain passive or 
resentful or both, an experience which he certainly does not often 
see as relevant to his own problems.
Yet it has also been my experience that when a regular university 
class does perceive the course as an experience they can use to resolve 
problems which are of concern to them, the sense of release, and 
the thrust of forward movement is astonishing. And this is true of 
courses as diverse as Mathematics and Personality.
I believe the current situation in Russian education also supplies 
evidence on this point. When a whole nation perceives itself as 
being faced with the urgent problem of being behind — in agricul­
ture, in industrial production, in scientific development, in weapons 
development — then an astonishing amount of significant learning 
takes place, of which the Sputniks are but one observable exam­
ple.
So the first implication for education might well be that we permit 
the student, at any level, to be in real contact with the relevant prob­
lems of his existence, so that he perceives problems and issues which

Significant Learning: In Therapy and in Education
287
he wishes to resolve. I am quite aware that this implication, like 
the others I shall mention, runs sharply contrary to the current trends 
in our culture, but I shall comment on that later.
I believe it would be quite clear from my description of therapy 
that an overall implication for education would be that the task of 
the teacher is to create a facilitating classroom climate in which 
significant learning can take place. This general implication can be 
broken down into several sub-sections.
T h e T e a c h e r ’s R e a l-n e s s
Learning will be facilitated, it would seem, if the teacher is con­
gruent. This involves the teacher’s being the person that he is, and 
being openly aware of the attitudes he holds. It means that he feels 
acceptant toward his own real feelings. Thus he becomes a real 
person in the relationship with his students. He can be enthusiastic 
about subjects he likes, and bored by topics he docs not like. He can 
be angry, but he can also be sensitive or sympathetic. Because he 
accepts his feeling as his feelings, he has no need to impose them on 
his students, or to insist that they feel the same way. He is a person, 
not a faceless embodiment of a curricular requirement, or a sterile 
pipe through which knowledge is passed from one generation to the 
next.
I can suggest only one bit of evidence which might support this 
view. As I think back over a number of teachers who have facilitated 
my own learning, it seems to me each one has this quality of being 
a real person. I wonder if your memory is the same. If so, perhaps 
it is less important that a teacher cover the allotted amount of the 
curriculum, or use the most approved audio-visual devices, than that 
he be congruent, real, in his relation to his students.
A c c e p t a n c e a nd U n d er sta n d in g
Another implication for the teacher is that significant learning may 
take place if the teacher can accept the student as he is, and can 
understand the feelings he possesses. Taking the third and fourth 
conditions of therapy as specified above, the teacher who can warmly 
accept, who can provide an unconditional positive regard, and who 
can empathize with the feelings of fear, anticipation, and discourage­

288
W
h a t  A r f  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r L iv in g ?
ment which are involved in meeting new material, will have done 
a great deal toward setting the conditions for learning. Clark Alous- 
takas, in his book, The Teacher and the Child (5), has given many 
excellent examples of individual and group situations from kinder­
garten to high school, in which the teacher has worked toward just 
this type of goal. It will perhaps disturb some that when the teacher 
holds such attitudes, when he is willing to be acceptant of feelings, 
it is not only attitudes toward school work itself which are expressed, 
but feelings about parents, feelings of hatred for brother or sister, 
feelings of concern about self —  the whole gamut of attitudes. Do 
such feelings have a right to exist openly in a school setting? It is 
my thesis that they do. They are related to the person’s becoming, 
to his effective learning and effective functioning, and to deal under­
standing^ and acceptantly with such feelings has a definite relation­
ship to the learning of long division or the geography of Pakistan.
P rovisio n o f R eso u r c es
This brings me to another implication which therapy holds for 
education. In therapy the resources for learning one’s self lie within. 
There is very little data which the therapist can supply which will be 
of help since the data to be dealt with exist within the person. In 
education this is not true. There are many resources of knowledge, 
of techniques, of theory, which constitute raw material for use. It 
seems to me that what I have said about therapy suggests that these 
materials, these resources, be made available to the students, not 
forced upon them. Here a wide range of ingenuity and sensitivity is 
an asset.
I do not need to list the usual resources which come to mind
— books, maps, workbooks, materials, recordings, work-space, tools, 
and the like. Let me focus for a moment on the way the teacher 
uses himself and his knowledge and experience as a resource. If the 
teacher holds the point of view I have been expressing then he would 
probably want to make himself available to his class in at least the 
following ways:
He would want to let them know of special experience and knowl­
edge he has in the field, and to let them know they could call on

Significant Learning: In Therapy and in Education
289
this knowledge. Yet he would not want them to feci that they must 
use him in this way.
He would want them to know that his own way of thinking about 
the field, and of organizing it, was available to them, even in lecture 
form, if they wished. Yet again he would want this to be perceived 
as an offer, w'hich could as readily be refused as accepted.
He would want to make himself known as a resource-finder. 
Whatever might be seriously wanted by an individual or by the 
whole group to promote their learning, he would be very willing 
to consider the possibilities of obtaining such a resource.
He would want the quality of his relationship to the group to be 
such that his feelings could be freely available to them, without 
being imposed on them or becoming a restrictive influence on them. 
He thus could share the excitements and enthusiasms of his own 
learnings, without insisting that the students follow in his footsteps; 
the feelings of disinterest, satisfaction, bafflement, or pleasure which 
he feels toward individual or group activities, without this becoming 
either a carrot or a stick for the student. His hope would be that he 
could say, simply for himself, “I don’t like that,” and that the stu­
dent with equal freedom could say, “ But I do.”
Thus whatever the resource he supplies — a book, space to work, 
a new tool, an opportunity for observation of an industrial process, 
a lecture based on his own study, a picturc, graph or map, his own 
emotional reactions — he would feel that these were, and would 
hope they would be perceived as, offerings to be used if they were 
useful to the student. He w’ould not feel them to be guides, or ex­
pectations, or commands, or impositions or requirements. He would 
offer himself, and all the other resources he could discover, for use.
T h e B a sic x
M o tiv e
It should be clear from this that his basic reliance would be upon 
the self-actualizing tendency in his students. The hypothesis upon 
which he would build is that students who arc in real contact with 
life problems wish to learn, want to grow, seek to find out, hope to 
master, desire to create. He would see his function as that of devel­
oping such a personal relationship with his students, and such a

290
W
h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  L iv in g ?
climate in his classroom, that these natural tendencies could come to 
their fruition.
S o m e  O m issio n s
These I see as some of the things which are implied by a therapeu­
tic viewpoint for the educational process. T o  make them a bit 
sharper, let me point out some of the things which are not implied.
I have not included lectures, talks, or expositions of subject mat­
ter which are imposed on the students. All of these procedures 
might be a part of the experience if they were desired, explicitly or 
implicitly, by the students. Yet even here, a teacher whose work was 
following through a hypothesis based on therapy would be quick to 
sense a shift in that desire. He might have been requested to lecture 
to the group (and to give a requested lecture is very different from 
the usual classroom experience), but if he detected a growing disin­
terest and boredom, he would respond to that, trying to understand 
the feeling which had arisen in the group, since his response to their 
feelings and attitudes would take precedence over his interest in 
expounding material.
I have not included any program of evaluation of the student’s 
learnings in terms of external criteria. I have not, in other words, 
included examinations. I believe that the testing of the student’s 
achievements in order to see if he meets some criterion held by the 
teacher, is directly contrary to the implications of therapy for sig­
nificant learning. In therapy, the examinations are set by life. The 
client meets them, sometimes passing, sometimes failing. He finds 
that he can use the resources of the therapeutic relationship and his 
experience in it to organize himself so that he can meet life’s tests 
more satisfyingly next time. I see this as the paradigm for education 
also. Let me try to spell out a fantasy of what it would mean.
In such an education, the requirements for many life situations 
would be a part of the resources the teacher provides. The student 
would have available the knowledge that he cannot enter engineering 
school without so much math; that he cannot get a job in X  corpora­
tion unless he has a college diploma; that he cannot become a psy­
chologist without doing an independent doctoral research; that he 
cannot be a doctor without knowledge of chemistry; that he cannot

Significant Learning: In Therapy and in Education
291
even drive a car without passing an examination on rules of the road. 
These are requirements set, not by the teacher, but by life. The 
teacher is there to provide the resources which the student can use 
to learn so as to be able to meet these tests.
There would be other in-school evaluations of similar sort. The 
student might well be faced with the fact that he cannot join the 
Math Club until he makes a certain score on a standardized mathe­
matics test; that he cannot develop his camera film until he has 
shown an adequate knowledge of chemistry and lab techniques; 
that he cannot join the special literature section until he has shown 
evidence of both wide reading and creative writing. The natural 
place of evaluation in life is as a ticket of entrance, not as a club over 
the recalcitrant. Our experience in therapy would suggest that it 
should be the same way in the school. It would leave the student as 
a self-respecting, self-motivated person, free to choose whether he 
wished to put forth the effort to gain these tickets of entrance. It 
would thus refrain from forcing him into conformity, from sacri­
ficing his creativity, and from causing him to live his life in terms 
of the standards of others.
I am quite aware that the two elements of which I have just been 
speaking —  the lectures and expositions imposed by the teacher on 
the group, and the evaluation of the individual by the teacher, con- 
situte the two major ingredients of current education. So when I 
say that experience in psychotherapy would suggest that they both 
be omitted, it should be quite clear that the implications of psycho­
therapy for education are startling indeed.
P r o b a b l e O u t c o m e s
If we are to consider such drastic changes as I have outlined, 
what would be the results which would justify them? There have 
been some research investigations of the outcomes of a student- 
centered type of teaching (1, 2, 4), though these studies are far from 
adequate. For one thing, the situations studied vary greatly in the 
extent to which they meet the conditions I have described. Most 
of them have extended only over a period of a few months, though 
one recent study with lower class children extended over a full 
year (4). Some involve the use of adequate controls, some do not.

292
W
h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  L in in g ?
I think we may say that these studies indicate that in classroom 
situations which at least attempt to approximate the climate I have 
described, the findings are as follows: Factual and curricular learn­
ing is roughly equal to the learning in conventional classes. Some 
studies report slightly more, some slightly less. The student-centered 
group shows gains significantly greater than the conventional class 
in personal adjustment, in self-initiated extra-curricular learning, in 
creativity, in self-responsibility.
I have come to realize, as I have considered these studies, and 
puzzled over the design of better studies which should be more in­
formative and conclusive, that findings from such research will 
never answer our questions. For all such findings must be evaluated 
in terms of the goals we have for education. If we value primarily 
the learning of knowledge, then we may discard the conditions I 
have described as useless, since there is no evidence that they lead 
to a greater rate or amount of factual knowledge. W e may then 
favor such measures as the one which I understand is advocated by 
a number of members of Congress — the setting up of a training 
school for scientists, modeled upon the military academies. But if 
we value creativity, if we deplore the fact that all of our germinal 
ideas in atomic physics, in psychology, and in other sciences have 
been borrowed from Europe, then we may wish to give a trial to 
ways of facilitating learning which give more promise of freeing 
the mind. If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the 
growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our 
present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of 
learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self­
initiated learning.
S o m e  C o n c l u d in g  I s s u e s
I have tried to sketch the kind of education which would be 
implied by what we have learned in the field of psychotherapy. I 
have endeavored to suggest very briefly what it would mean if the 
central focus of the teacher’s effort were to develop a relationship,

Significant Learning: In Therapy and in Education
293
an atmosphere, which was conducive to self-motivated, self-actual- 
izing, significant learning. But this is a direction which leads sharply 
away from current educational practices and educational trends. 
Let me mention a few of the very diverse issues and questions which 
need to be faced if we are to think constructively about such an 
approach.
In the first place, how do we conceive the goals of education? The 
approach I have outlined has, I believe, advantages for achieving 
certain goals, but not for achieving others. W e need to be clear as 
to the way we see the purposes of education.
W hat are the actual outcomes of the kind of education I have 
described? W e need a great deal more of rigorous, hard-headed 
research to know the actual results of this kind of education as 
compared with conventional education. Then we can choose on 
the basis of the facts.
Even if we were to try such an approach to the facilitation of 
learning, there are many difficult issues. Could we possibly permit 
students to come in contact with real issues? Our whole culture — 
through custom, through the law, through the efforts of labor unions 
and management, through the attitudes of parents and teachers — 
is deeply committed to keeping young people away from any touch 
with real problems. They are not to work, they should not carry 
responsibility, they have no business in civic or political problems, 
they have no place in international concerns, they simply should 
be guarded from any direct contact with the real problems of in­
dividual and group living. They are not expected to help about 
the home, to earn a living, to contribute to science, to deal with 
moral issues. This is a deep seated trend which has lasted for more 
than a generation. Could it possibly be reversed?
Another issue is whether we could permit knowledge to be or­
ganized in and by the individual, or whether it is to be organized for 
the individual. Here teachers and educators line up with parents 
and national leaders to insist that the pupil must be guided. He must 
be inducted into knowledge wre have organized for him. He cannot 
be trusted to organize knowledge in functional terms for himself. 
As Herbert Hoover says of high school students, “ You simply can­

294
W
h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p l i c a t i o n s  f o r  L iv in g ?
not expect kids of those ages to determine the sort of education 
they need unless they have some guidance.” * This seems so obvious 
to most people that even to question it is to seem somewhat un­
balanced. Even a chancellor of a university questions whether free­
dom is really necessary in education, saying that perhaps we have 
overestimated its value. He says the Russians have advanced mightily 
in science without it, and implies that we should learn from them.
Still another issue is whether we would wish to oppose the strong 
current trend toward education as drill in factual knowledge. All 
must learn the same facts in the same way. Admiral Rickover states 
it as his belief that “ in some fashion we must devise a way to intro­
duce uniform standards into American education. . . . For the first 
time, parents would have a real yardstick to measure their schools. 
If the local school continued to teach such pleasant subjects as ‘life 
adjustment’ . . . instead of French and physics, its diploma would 
be, for all the world to see, inferior.”!  This is a statement of a very 
prevalent view. Even such a friend of forward-looking views in 
education as Max Lerner says at one point, “ All that a school can 
ever hope to do is to equip the student with tools which he can later 
use to become an educated man” (5, p. 741). It is quite clear that 
he despairs of significant learning taking place in our school system, 
and feels that it must take place outside. All the school can do is to 
pound in the tools.
One of the most painless ways of inculcating such factual tool 
knowledge is the “teaching machine” being devised by B. F. Skinner 
and his associates (10). This group is demonstrating that the teacher 
is an outmoded and ineffective instrument for teaching arithmetic, 
trigonometry, French, literary appreciation, geography, or other 
factual subjects. There is simply no doubt in my mind that these 
teaching machines, providing immediate rewards for “ right” an­
swers, will be further developed, and will come into wide use. Here 
is a new contribution from the field of the behavioral sciences with 
which we must come to terms. Does it take the place of the ap­
proach I have described, or is it supplemental to it? Here is one of 
the problems we must consider as we face toward the future.

295
I hope that by posing these issues, I have made it clear that the 
double-barreled question of what constitutes significant learning, 
and how it is to be achieved, poses deep and serious problems for all 
of us. It is not a time when timid answers will suffice. I have tried 
to give a definition of significant learning as it appears in psycho­
therapy, and a description of the conditions which facilitate such 
learning. I have tried to indicate some implications of these condi­
tions for education. I have, in other words, proposed one answer to 
these questions. Perhaps we can use what I have said, against the 
twin backdrops of current public opinion and currcnt knowledge 
in the behavioral sciences, as a start for discovering some fresh an­
swers of our own.

Student-Centered Teaching 
as Experienced by a 
Participant
I
t will have been evident earlier in this volume that I cannot be 
content simply to give my view of psychotherapy: I regard it as 
essential to give the client's perception of the experience also, since 
this is indeed the raw material from which 1 have fommlated my 
own views. In the same way I found I could not be content simply 
to formulate my views of what education is when it is built upon 
the learnings from psychotherapy: 1 wanted to give the student's per­
ception of such education also.
To this end I considered the various reports and “ reaction sheets” 
which I have assembled from students in different courses over the 
years. Excerpts from these would have fulfilled my purpose. In the 
endy
 however, I chose to use two documents written by Dr. Samuel 
Tenenbaum, the first ivimediately after his participation in a 
course of mine, the second a letter to vie one year later. I am deeply 
grateful to him for his permission to use these personal statements. 
I would like to place them in context for the reader.
In the swmncr of 1958 1 was invited to teach a four-week course 
at Brandeis University. My recollection is that the title was “ The 
297

298
W h a t A re th e I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
Process of Personality C h a n g e / had no great expectations for the 
coarse. It was to be one of several courses which the students were 
taking, meeting for three two-hour sessions per week, rather than 
the concentrated workshop pattern which I prefer. I learned in ad­
vance that the group was to be unusually heterogeneous —  teachers, 
doctoral candidates in psychology, counselors, several priests, at 
least one from a foreign country, psychotherapists in private prac­
tice, school psychologists. The group was, on the average, more 
mature and experienced than would ordinarily be found in a uni­
versity course. I felt very relaxed about the whole thing. I would 
do what I could to help make this a meaningful experience for us allt 
but I doubted that it could have the impact of, for example, the 
workshops on counseling which I had conducted.
Perhaps it was because I had very modest expectations of the group 
and of myself, that it went so well. I would without doubt class it 
as among the most satisfying of my attempts to facilitate learning in 
courses or workshops. This should be borne in mind in reading Dr. 
TenenbawrCs material.
I would like to digress for a moment here to say that I feel far 
viore assurance in confronting a new client in therapy than I do in 
confronting a new group. I feel 1 have a sufficient grasp of the 
conditions of therapy so that I have a reasonable confidence as to the 
process which will ensue. But with groups I have much less con­
fidence. Sometimes when I have had every reason to suppose a 
course would go well, the vital, self-initiated, self-directed learning 
has simply not occurred to any great degree. At other times when I 
have been dubious, it has gone extremely well. To me this means 
that our formulation of the process of facilitating learning in educa­
tion is not nearly as accurate or complete as our formulations regard­
ing the therapeutic process.
But to return to the Brandeis summer course. It was clearly a 
highly significant experience for almost all of the participants, as 
evident in their reports on the course. I was particularly interested 
in the report by Dr. Tenenbaum, written as much for his colleagues 
as for me. Here was a mature scholar, riot an impressionable young 
student. Here was a sophisticated educator, who already had to his 
credit a published biography of William H. Kilpatrick, the philoso-

Student-Centered Teaching
299
phcr of education. Hence his perceptions of the experience seemed 
unusually valuable.
I would not want it to be understood that I shared all of Dr. 
Tenenbaum's perceptions. Portions of the experience 1 perceived 
quite differently, but this is what made his observations so helpful. 
I felt particularly concerned that it seemed to him so much a 
“Rogers” approach, that it was si?nply my person and idiosyncrasies 
which made the experience what it was.
For this reason 1 was delighted to get a long letter from him a 
year later, reporting his own experience in teaching. This confirmed 
what 1 have learned from a wide variety of individuals, that it is not 
simply the personality of a specific teacher which makes this a 
dynamic learning experience, but the operation of certain principles 
'which may be utilized by any “facilitator” who holds the appropriate 
attitudes.
1 believe the two accounts by Dr. Tenenbaum will make it clear 
•why teachers who have experienced the kind of group learning 
which is described can never return to more stereotyped ways of 
education. In spite of frustration and occasional failure, one keeps 
trying to discover, with each new group, the conditions which will 
unleash this vital learning experience.
Carl R. R ogers and N on-D irective Teaching 
by Samuel Tenenbaum, Ph.D.
a s  o n e  i n t e r e s t e d  in education, I have participated in a classroom 
X x  methodology that is so unique and so special that I feel im­
pelled to share the experience. The technique, it seems to me, is so 
radically different from the customary and the accepted, so under­
mining of the old, that it should be known more widely. As good a 
description of the process as any —  I suppose the one that Carl R.

Rogers, the instructor, himself would be inclined to use — would be 
“ non-directive” teaching.
I had some notion what that term meant, but frankly I was not 
prepared for anything that proved so overwhelming. It is not that 
I am convention-bound. M y strongest educational influences stem 
from William Heard Kilpatrick and John Dewey, and anyone who 
has even the slightest acquaintance with their thinking would know 
that it docs not smack of the narrow or the provincial. But this 
method which I saw Dr. Rogers carry out in a course which he gave 
at Brandeis University was so unusual, something I could not believe 
possible, unless I was part of the experience. I hope I shall manage 
to describe the method in a way to give you some inkling of the 
feelings, the emotions, the warmth and the enthusiasms that the 
method engendered.
The course was altogther unstructured; and it was exactly that. 
A t no moment did anyone know, not even the instructor, what the 
next moment would bring forth in the classroom, what subject 
would come up for discussion, what questions would be raised, what 
personal needs, feelings and emotions aired. This atmosphere of non- 
structured freedom — as free as human beings could allow each 
other to be —  was set by Dr. Rogers himself. In a friendly, re­
laxed way, he sat down with the students (about 25 in number) 
around a large table and said it would be nice if we stated our pur­
pose and introduced ourselves. There ensued a strained silence; no 
one spoke up. Finally, to break it, one student timidly raised his 
hand and spoke his piece. Another uncomfortable silence, and then 
another upraised hand. Thereafter, the hands rose more rapidly. At 
no time did the instructor urge any student to speak.
U n s t r u c t u r e d  A p p r o a c h
Afterwards, he informed the class that he had brought with him 
quantities of materials —  reprints, brochures, articles, books; he 
handed out a bibliography of recommended reading. At no time 
did he indicate that he expected students to read or do anything

Student-Centered Teaching
301
else. As I recall, he made only one request. Would some student 
volunteer to set up this material in a special room which had been 
reserved for students of the course? Tw o students promptly volun­
teered. He also said he had with him recorded tapes of therapeutic 
sessions and also reels of motion pictures. This created a flurry of 
excitement, and students asked whether they could be heard and seen 
and Dr. Rogers answered yes. The class then decided how it could 
be done best. Students volunteered to run tape recorders, find a 
movie projector; for the most part this too was student initiated and 
arranged.
Thereafter followed four hard, frustrating sessions. During this 
period, the class didn’t seem to get anywhere. Students spoke at 
random, saying whatever came into their heads. It all seemed chaotic, 
aimless, a waste of time. A student would bring up some aspect of 
Rogers’ philosophy; and the next student, completely disregarding 
the first, would take the group away in another direction; and a 
third, completely disregarding the first two, would start fresh on 
something else altogether. At times there were some faint efforts at 
a cohesive discussion, but for the most part the classroom proceed­
ings seemed to lack continuity and direction. The instructor received 
every contribution with attention and regard. He did not find any 
student’s contribution in order or out of order.
The class was not prepared for such a totally unstructured ap­
proach. They did not know how to proceed. In their perplexity 
and frustration, they demanded that the teacher play the role as­
signed to him by custom and tradition; that he set forth for us in 
authoritative language what was right and wrong, what was good 
and bad. Had they not come from far distances to learn from the 
oracle himself? W ere they not fortunate? Were they not about to 
be initiated in the right rituals and practices by the great man himself, 
the founder of the movement that bears his name? The notebooks 
were poised for the climactic moment when the oracle would give 
forth, but mostly they remained untouched.
Queerly enough, from the outset, even in their anger, the members 
of the group felt joined together, and outside the classroom, there 
was an excitement and a ferment, for even in their frustration, they

302
W h a t A r e t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
had communicated as never before in any classroom, and probably 
never before in quite the way they had. The class was bound to­
gether by a common, unique experience. In the Rogers class, they 
had spoken their minds; the words did not come from a book, nor 
were they the reflection of the instructor’s thinking, nor that of any 
other authority. The ideas, emotions and feelings came from them­
selves; and this was the releasing and the exciting process.
In this atmosphere of freedom, something for which they had not 
bargained and for which they were not prepared, the students spoke 
up as students seldom do. During this period, the instructor took 
many blows; and it seemed to me that many times he appeared to be 
shaken; and although he was the source of our irritation, we had, 
strange as it may seem, a great affection for him, for it did not seem 
right to be angry with a man who was so sympathetic, so sensitive to 
the feelings and ideas of others. W e all felt that what was involved 
was some slight misunderstanding, which once understood and 
remedied would make everything right again. But our instructor, 
gentle enough on the surface, had a “whim of steel.” He didn’t seem 
to understand; and if he did, he was obstinate and obdurate; he re­
fused to come around. Thus did this tug-of-war continue. We all 
looked to Rogers and Rogers looked to us. One student, amid gen­
eral approbation, observed: “We are Rogers-centered, not student- 
centered. W e have come to learn from Rogers.”
E n c o u r a g in g  T h i n k i n g
Another student had discovered that Rogers had been influenced 
by Kilpatrick and Dewey, and using this idea as a springboard, he 
said he thought he perceived what Rogers was trying to get at. He 
thought Rogers wanted students to think independently, creatively; 
he wanted students to become deeply involved with their very per­
sons, their very selves, hoping that this might lead to the “ recon­
struction” of the person — in the Dewey sense of the term — the 
person’s outlook, attitudes, values, behavior. This would be a true 
reconstruction of experience; it would be learning in a real sense. 
Certainly, he didn’t want the course to end in an examination based

Student-Centered Teaching
303
on textbooks and lectures, followed by the traditional end-term 
grade, which generally means completion and forgetting.* Rogers 
had expressed the belief almost from the outset of the course that 
no one can teach anyone else anything. But thinking, this student 
insisted, begins at the fork in the road, the famed dilemma set up by 
Dewey. As we reach the fork in the road, we do not know which 
road to take if we are to reach our destination; and then we begin 
to examine the situation. Thinking starts at that point.
Kilpatrick also sought original thinking from his students and also 
rejected a regurgitant textbook kind of learning, but he presented 
crucial problems for discussion, and these problems aroused a great 
deal of interest, and they also created vast changes in the person. 
W hy can’t committees of students or individual students get up such 
problems for discussion? t Rogers listened sympathetically and said, 
“I see you feel strongly about this?” That disposed of that. If I re­
call correctly, the next student who spoke completely disregarded 
what had been suggested and started afresh on another topic, quite 
in conformity with the custom set by the class.
Spasmodically, through the session, students referred favorably to 
the foregoing suggestion, and they began to demand more insistently 
that Rogers assume the traditional role of a teacher. At this point, 
the blows were coming Rogers’ way rather frequently and strongly 
and I thought I saw him bend somewhat before them. (Privately, he 
denied he was so affected.) During one session, a student made the 
suggestion that he lecture one hour and that we have a class discus-
* 
It should be noted that Dr. Ropers neither agreed nor disagreed. It was 
not his habit to respond to students’ contributions unless a remark was directed 
specifically to him; and even then he might choose not to answer. His main 
objcct, it seemed to me, was to follow students’ contributions intelligently and 
sympathetically.
+ One student compiled such a list, had it mimeographed, distributed it, and 
for practical purposes that was the end o f that.
In this connection, another illustration may be in order. At the first session, 
Rogers brought to class tape recordings of therapeutic sessions. He explained 
that he was not comfortable in a teacher’s role and he came “loaded,” and the 
recordings served as a sort of security. One student continually insisted that 
he play the recordings, and after considerable pressure from the class, he did 
so, but he complied reluctantly; and all told, despite the pressure, he did not 
piay tnem tor more than an hour in all the sessions. Apparently, Rogers pre­
ferred the students to make real live recordings rather than listen to those 
which could only interest them in an academic way.

304
W h a t A r e t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
sion the next. This one suggestion seemed to fit into his plans. He 
said he had with him an unpublished paper. He warned us that it 
was available and we could read it by ourselves. But the student 
said it would not be the same. The person, the author, would be out 
of it, the stress, the inflection, the emotion, those nuances which give 
value and meaning to words. Rogers then asked the students if that 
was what they wanted. They said yes. He read for over an hour. 
After the vivid and acrimonious exchanges to which we had become 
accustomed, this was certainly a letdown, dull and soporific to the 
extreme. This experience squelched all further demands for lectur­
ing. In one of the moments when he apologized for this episode 
( “ It’s better, more excusable, when students demand it.” ), he said: 
“You asked me to lecture. It is true I am a resource, but what sense 
would there be in my lecturing? I have brought a great quantity of 
material, reprints of any number of lectures, articles, books, tape re­
cordings, movies.”
By the fifth session, something definite had happened; there was 
no mistaking that. Students spoke to one another; they by-passed 
Rogers. Students asked to be heard and wanted to be heard, and 
what before was a halting, stammering, self-conscious group became 
an interacting group, a brand new cohesive unit, carrying on in a 
unique way; and from them came discussion and thinking such as 
no other group but this could repeat or duplicate. The instructor 
also joined in, but his role, more important than any in the group, 
somehow became merged with the group; the group was important, 
the center, the base of operation, not the instructor.
What caused it? I can only conjecture as to the reason. I believe 
that what happened was this: For four sessions students refused to 
believe that the instructor would refuse to play the traditional role. 
They still believed that he would set the tasks; that he would be the 
center of whatever happened and that he would manipulate the 
group. It took the class four sessions to realize that they were 
wrong; that he came to them with nothing outside of himself, out­
side of his own person; that if they really wanted something to hap­
pen, it was they who had to provide the content — an uncomfort­
able, challenging situation indeed. It was they who had to speak up, 
with all the risks that that entailed. As part of the process, they

Student-Centered Teaching
305
shared, they took exception, they agreed, they disagreed. A t any 
rate, their persons, their deepest selves were involved; and from this 
situation, this special, unique group, this new creation was born.
I m p o r t a n c e  o f A c c e p t a n c e
As you may know, Rogers believes that if a person is accepted, 
fully accepted, and in this acceptance there is no judgment, only 
compassion and sympathy, the individual is able to come to grips 
w ith himself, to develop the courage to give up his defenses nnd face 
his true self. I saw this process work. Amid the early efforts to com­
municate, to find a 7
nodus vivendi, there had been in the group tenta­
tive exchanges of feelings, emotions and ideas; but after the fourth 
session, and progressively thereafter, this group, haphazardly thrown 
together, became close to one another and their true selves appeared. 
As they interacted, there were moments of insight and revelation and 
understanding that were almost awesome in nature; they were what, 
I believe, Rogers would describe as “moments of therapy,” those 
pregnant moments when you see a human soul revealed before you, 
in all its breathless wonder; and then a silence, almost like reverence, 
would overtake the class. And each member of the class became 
enveloped with a warmth and a loveliness that border on the mystic. 
I for one, and I am quite sure the others also, never had an experi­
ence quite like this. It was learning and therapy; and by therapy 
I do not mean illness, but what might be characterized by a healthy 
change in the person, an increase in his flexibility, his openness, his 
willingness to listen. In the process, we all felt elevated, freer, more 
accepting of ourselves and others, more open to new ideas, trying 
hard to understand and accept.
This is not a perfect world, and there was evidence of hostility as 
members differed. Somehow in this setting every blow was softened, 
as if the sharp edges had been removed; if undeserved, students 
would go off to something else; and the blow was somehow lost. In 
my own case, even those students who originally irritated me, with 
further acquaintance I began to accept and respect; and the thought 
occurred to me as I tried to understand what was happening: Once

306
W h a t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
you come close to a person, perceive his thoughts, his emotions, his 
feelings, he becomes not only understandable but good and desirable. 
Some of the more aggressive ones spoke more than they should, more 
than their right share, but the group itself, by its own being, not by 
setting rules, eventually made its authority felt; and unless a person 
was very sick or insensitive, members more or less, in this respect, 
conformed to what was expected of them. The problem — the hos­
tile, the dominant, the neurotic — was not too acute; and yet if 
measured in a formal way, with a stop watch, at no time was a ses­
sion free of aimless talk and waste of time. But yet as I watched the 
process, the idea persisted that perhaps this waste of time may be 
neccssary; it may very well be that that is the way man learns best; 
for certainly, as I look back at the whole experience, I am fairly 
certain that it would have been impossible to learn as much or as 
well or as thoroughly in the traditional classroom setting. If we 
accept Dewey’s definition of education as the reconstruction of ex­
perience, what better way can a person learn than by becoming 
involved with his whole self, his very person, his root drives, emo­
tions, attitudes and values? N o series of facts or arguments, no 
matter how logically or brilliantly arranged, can even faintly com­
pare with that sort of thing.
In the course of this process, I saw hard, inflexible, dogmatic per­
sons, in the brief period of several weeks, change in front of my 
eyes and become sympathetic, understanding and to a marked de­
gree non-judgmental. I saw neurotic, compulsive persons ease up 
and become more accepting of themselves and others. In one in­
stance, a student who particularly impressed me by his change, told 
me when I mentioned this: “It is true. I feel less rigid, more open 
to the world. And I like myself better for it. I don’t believe I ever 
learned so much anywhere.” I saw shy persons become less shy 
and aggressive persons more sensitive and moderate.
One might say that this appears to be essentially an emotional 
process. But that I believe would be altogether inaccurate in de­
scribing it. There was a great deal of intellectual content, but the 
intellectual content was meaningful and crucial to the person, in a 
sense that it meant a great deal to him as a person. In fact, one 
student brought up this very question. “Should we be concerned,”

Student-Centered, Teaching
307
he asked, “ only with the emotions? Has the intellect no play?” It 
was my turn to ask, “ Is there any student who has read as much or 
thought as much for any other course?”
The answer was obvious. W e had spent hours and hours reading; 
the room reserved for us had occupants until 10 o’clock at night, and 
then many left only because the university guards wanted to close 
the building. Students listened to recordings; they s;nv motion 
pictures; but best of all, they talked and talked and talked. In the 
traditional course, the instructor lectures and indicates what is to 
be read and learned; students dutifully record all this in their note­
books, take an examination and feel good or bad, depending on 
the outcome; but in nearly all cases it is a complete experience, with 
a sense of finality; the laws of forgetting begin to operate rapidly 
and inexorably. In the Rogers course, students read and thought 
inside and outside the class; it was they who chose from this read­
ing and thinking what was meaningful to them, not the instruc­
tor.
This non-directive kind of teaching, I should point out, was not 
100 per cent successful. There were three or four students who 
found the whole idea distasteful. Even at the end of the course, al­
though nearly all became enthusiastic, one student to my knowl­
edge, was intensely negative in his feelings; another was highly 
critical. These wanted the instructor to provide them with a 
rounded-out intellectual piece of merchandise which they could 
commit to memory and then give back on an examination. They 
would then have the assurance that they had learned what they 
should. As one said, “ If I had to make a report as to what I 
learned in this course, what could I say?” Admittedly, it would 
be much more difficult than in a traditional course, if not impossible.
The Rogers method was free and flowing and open and permis­
sive. A student would start an interesting discussion; it would be 
token up by a second; but a third student might take us away in 
another direction, bringing up a personal matter of no interest to 
the class; and we would all feel frustrated. But this was like life, 
flowing on like a river, seemingly futile, with never the same water 
there, flowing on, with no one knowing what would happen the 
next moment. But in this there was an expectancy, an alertness, an

308
W h a t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
aliveness; it seemed to me as near a smear of life as one could get in 
a classroom. For the authoritarian person, who puts his faith in 
neatly piled up facts, this method I believe can be threatening, for 
here he gets no reassurance, only an openness, a flowing, no closure.
A  N e w  M e t h o d o l o g y
I believe that a great deal of the stir and the ferment that char­
acterized the class was due to this lack of closure. In the lunch 
room, one could recognize Rogers’ students by their animated dis­
cussions, by their desire to be together; and sometimes, since there 
was no table large enough, they would sit two and three tiers deep; 
and they would eat with plates on their laps. As Rogers himself 
points out, there is no finality in the process. He himself never 
summarizes (against every conventional law of teaching). 
The 
issues are left unresolved; the problems raised in class are always in 
a state of flux, on-going. In their need to know, to come to some 
agreement, students gather together, wanting understanding, seek­
ing closure. Even in the matter of grades, there is no closure. A 
grade means an end; but Dr. Rogers does not give the grade; it is 
the student who suggests the grade; and since he does so, even this 
sign of completion is left unresolved, without an end, unclosed. 
Also, since the course is unstructured, each has staked his person in 
the course; he has spoken, not with the textbook as the gauge, but 
with his person, and thus as a self he has communicated with others, 
and because of this, in contradistinction to the impersonal subject 
matter that comprises the normal course, there develops this close­
ness and warmth.
T o describe the many gracious acts that occurred might convey 
some idea of this feeling of closeness. One student invited the class 
to her home for a cookout. Another student, a priest from Spain, 
was so taken with the group that he talked of starting a publication 
to keep track of what was happening to the group members after 
they disbanded. A group interested in student counseling met on its 
own. A member arranged for the class to visit a mental hospital 
for children and adults; also he arranged for us to see the expcri-

Student-Centered Teaching
309
mental work being done with psychotic patients by Dr. Lindsley. 
Class members brought in tape recordings and printed matter to 
add to the library material set aside for our use. In every way the 
spirit of good-will and friendliness was manifest to an extent that 
happens only in rare and isolated instances. In the many, many 
courses I have taken I have not seen the like. In this connection, 
it should be pointed out that the members comprised a group that 
had been haphazardly thrown together; they had come from many 
backgrounds and they included a wide age range.
I believe that what has been described above is truly a creative 
addition to classroom methodology; it is radically different from 
the old. That it has the capacity to move people, to make them 
freer, more open-minded, more flexible, I have no doubt. I myself 
witnessed the power of this method. I believe that non-directive 
teaching has profound implications which even those who accept this 
point of view cannot at present fully fathom. Its importance, I be­
lieve, goes beyond the classroom and extends to every area where 
human beings communicate and try to live with one another.
More specifically, as a classroom methodology, it warrants the 
widest discussion, inquiry and experimentation. It has the possi­
bility of opening up a whole new dimension of thinking, fresh and 
original, for in its approach, in its practice, in its philosophy it differs 
so fundamentally from the old. It seems to me this approach ought 
to be tried out in every area of learning — elementary, high school, 
college, wherever human beings gather to learn and improve on the 
old. At this stage we should not be overly concerned about its limi­
tations and inadequacies, since the method has not been refined and 
we do not know as much about it as we ought. As a new technique, 
it starts off with a handicap. W e are loath to give up the old. The 
old is bolstered by tradition, authority and respectability; and we 
ourselves are its product. If we view education, however, as the 
reconstruction of experience, does not this presume that the in­
dividual must do his own reconstructing? He must do it himself, 
through the reorganization of his deepest self, his values, his at­
titudes, his very person. What better method is there to engross the 
individual; to bring him, his ideas, his feelings into communication 
with others; to break down the barriers that create isolation in a

world where for his own mental safety and health, man has to learn 
to be part of mankind?

A Personal Teaching Experience
(as reported to Dr. Rogers one year later) 
by
Samuel Tenenbaum, Ph.D.
I
 f e e l  im p e lle d  to write to you about my first experience in teach­
ing after being exposed to your thinking and influence. You 
may or may not know I had a phobia about teaching. Since my 
work with you, I began to perceive more clearly where the difficulty 
lay. It was mostly in my concept of the role I had to play as a 
teacher —  the motivator, director and the production chief of a 
performance. I always feared being “ hung up” in the classroom — 
I believe it’s your expression and I have come to like it — the class 
listless, uninterested, not responding, and my yammering and yam­
mering, until I lost poise, the sentences not forming, coming out 
artificially, and the time moving slowly, slowly, ever more slowly. 
This was the horror I imagined. I suppose pieces of this happen to 
every teacher, but I would put them all together, and I would ap­
proach the class with foreboding, not at ease, not truly myself.
And now comes my experience. I was asked to give two sum­
mer courses for the Graduate School of Education of Yeshiva Uni­
versity, but I had a perfect alibi. I was going to Europe and I 
couldn’t. W ouldn’t I give an interim course, a concentrated course 
of 14 sessions during the month of June; and this would not inter­
fere with the trip? I had no excuse and I accepted — because 1
 no 
longer wanted to dodge the situation and more, also, because I was 
determined once and for all to face it. If I didn’t like to teach (I 
haven’t taught for nearly ten years), I would learn something. And 
if I did, I would also learn something. And if I had to suffer, it was

Student-Centered Teaching
311
best this way, since the course was concentrated and the time ele­
ment was short.
You know that I have been strongly influenced in my thinking 
about education by Kilpatrick and Dewey. But now I had another 
powerful ingredient — you. 
When I first met my class, I did 
something I never did before. I was frank about my feelings. In­
stead of feeling that a teacher should know and students were there 
to be taught, I admitted weaknesses, doubts, dilemmas, and N O T  
K N O W IN G . Since I sort of dethroned my role as a teacher to 
the class and myself, my more natural self came out more freely 
and I found myself talking easily and even creatively. By “crea­
tively” I mean ideas came to me as I spoke, brand new ideas which 
I felt were good.
Another important difference: It is true that since I was influenced 
by the Kilpatrick methodology I always welcomed the widest dis­
cussion, but I now know, I still wanted and expected my students to 
know the text and the lecture material set out for them. Even 
worse, I now know that although 1
 welcomed discussion, I wanted, 
above all things, that, after all was said and done, the final con­
clusions of the class to come out according to my way of thinking. 
Hence none of the discussions were real discussions, in the sense 
that it was open and free and inquiring; none of the questions were 
real questions, in the sense that they sought to evoke thinking; all 
of them were loaded, in the sense that I had pretty definite con­
victions about what I thought were good answers and at times 
right answers. Hence, I came to the class with subject matter and 
my students were really instruments by which situations were 
manipulated to produce the inclusion of what I regarded as de­
sirable subject matter.
In this last course, I didn’t have the courage to discard all subject 
matter, but this time I really listened to my students; I gave them 
understanding and sympathy. Although I would spend hours and 
hours preparing for each session, I found that not once did I refer to 
a note from the voluminous material with which I entered the 
room. I allowed students free rein, not holding anyone down to 
any set course, and I permitted the widest diversion; and I followed 
wherever the students led.

312
W h a t A re ih e  I m p l ic a t io n s for L ivin g?
I remember discussing this with a prominent educator and he said, 
in w
 hat I thought was a disappointed and disapproving tone: “You 
insist, of course, on good thinking.” I quoted William James, who 
in effect said that man is a speck of reason in an ocean of emotion. 
I told him that I was more interested in what I would call a “ third 
dimension,” the feeling part of the students.
I cannot say I followed you all the May, Dr. Rogers, since I 
would express opinions and at times, unfortunately, lecture; and 
that I believe is bad, since students, once authoritative opinions 
are expressed, tend not to think, but to try to guess what is in the 
instructor’s head and provide him with what he might like, so as 
to find favor in his eyes. If I had to do it over again, I would have 
less of that. But I did try and I believe I succeeded in large measure 
to give to each student a sense of dignity, respect and acceptance; 
farthest from my mind was to check on them or evaluate and mark 
them.
And the result — and this is why I am writing you — was for me 
an unparalleled experience, inexplicable in ordinary terms. I myself 
cannot fully account for it, except to be grateful that it happened 
to me. Some of the very qualities which I experienced in your 
course I found in this which I gave. I found myself liking these 
particular students as I have never liked any other group of persons, 
and I found — and they expressed this in their final report — that 
they themselves began to feel warm and kindly and accepting of 
one another. Orally and in their papers, they told of how moved 
they were, how much they learned, how well they felt. For me 
this was a brand new experience, and I was overwhelmed and 
humbled by it. I have had students who, I believe, respected and 
admired me, but I never had a classroom experience from which 
came such warmth and closeness. Incidentally, following your ex­
ample, I avoided setting any fixed requirements in terms of reading 
or classroom preparation.
That the foregoing was not “biased perception” was evidenced 
from reports I got outside the classroom. The students had said 
such nice things about me that faculty members wanted to sit in the 
class. Best of all, the students at the end of the course wrote Dean

Student-Centered Teaching
313
Benjamin Fine a letter in which they said the nicest things about me. 
And the Dean in turn wrote me to the same effect.
T o say that I am overwhelmed by what happened only faintly 
reflects my feelings. I have taught for many years but I have never 
experienced anything remotely resembling what occurred. I, for my 
part, never have found in the classroom so much of the whole per­
son coming forth, so deeply involved, so deeply stirred. Further, I 
question if in the traditional set-up, with its emphasis on subject 
matter, examinations, grades, there is, or there can be a place for the 
“becoming” person, with his deep and manifold needs, as he struggles 
to fulfill himself. But this is going far afield. I can only report to 
you what happened and to say that I am grateful and that I am also 
humbled by the experience. I would like you to know this, for 
again you have added to and enriched my life and being.*

That this was not an isolated experience for Dr. Tenenhaum is indicared 
by a quotation from still another personal communication, many months larcr. 
He says: “ With another group I taught, following the first one, similar at­
titudes developed, only they were more accentuated, because, I belic\c, I 
was more comfortable with the technique and, I hope, more expert. In this 
second group there was the same release of the person, the same exhilaration 
and excitement, the same warmth, the same mystery that attaches to a person 
as he succeeds in shedding portions of his skin. Students from my group 
told me that while attending other classes, their eyes would meet, drawn to 
one another, as if they were unique and apart, as if they were bound together 
by a special experience. In this second group, also, I found that the students 
had developed a personal closencss, so that at the end of the semester they 
talked of having annual reunions. They said that somehow or other they 
wanted to keep this experience alive and not lose one another. They j Iso 
spoke of radical and fundamental changes in their person —  in oudook, in 
values, in feelings, in attitudes both toward themselves and toward others.’’

The Implications of 
Client-Centered Therapy 
for Family Life

 was asked,
 
several years ago,
 
to speak to a local group on 
any topic I wished,

 decided to take a specific look at the 
changes in behavior exhibited by our clients in their family relation­
ships. This paper was the result.
£
a s  an in c r e a sin g  n u m b e r  of our therapists and counselors have 
jC \ dealt with troubled individuals and groups, there has been agree­
ment that our experience is relevant to, and has implications for, 
every area of interpersonal relationships. An attempt has been made 
to spell out some of the implications in certain areas — in the field 
of education, for example, in the area of group leadership, in the 
area of inter-group relationships — but we have never tried to make 
explicit what it means in family life. This is the realm with which 
I should like to deal now, trying to give as clear a picture as 1
 can

of what meanings a client-centered point of view seems to have for 
that closest of all interpersonal circles — the family group.
I do not wish to approach this from an abstract or theoretical 
level. W hat I wish to do is to present something of the changes our 
clients have experienced in their family relationships as they en­
deavor to work toward a more satisfactory life in their contacts with 
a therapist. I shall draw heavily on the verbatim statements of these 
people in order that you may get the flavor of their actual experi­
ence, and draw your own conclusions for yourself.
Although some of the experience of our clients seems to run 
counter to current concepts of what is involved in constructive 
family living, I am not particularly interested in arguing these dif­
ferences. Also I am not particularly interested in setting up some 
model for family life in general, or in proposing the manner in 
which you should live in your family situation. I simply wish to 
present the gist of the experience of some very real people in some 
very real and often difficult family situations. Perhaps their strug­
gles to live in a satisfying fashion will have some meaning for you.
What then, are some of the ways in wliich clients change in their 
family living, as a consequence of client-centered therapy?
M o re E x p r e ssiv e o f F e e l in g
In the first place it is our experience that our clients gradually 
come to express more fully, to members of their families as well as 
to others, their true feelings. This applies to feelings that might be 
thought of as negative — resentment, anger, shame, jealousy, dis­
like, annoyance — as well as feelings which might be thought of as 
positive —  tenderness, admiration, liking, love. It is as though the 
client discovers in therapy that it is possible to drop the mask he has 
been wearing, and become more genuinely himself. A husband finds 
himself becoming furiously angry with his wife, and expressing this 
anger, where before he had maintained — or thought he had main­
tained — a calm and objective attitude toward her behavior. It is 
as though the map of expression of feelings has come to match more 
closely the territory of the actual emotional experience. Parents 
and children, husbands and wives, come closer to expressing the 
feelings which really exist in them, rather than hiding their true

316
W h a t A r e t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L i u n c ?
feelings from the other person, or from the other person and them­
selves.
Perhaps an illustration or two would make this point more dear. 
A young wife, Mrs. Al., comes for counseling. Her complaint is that 
her husband, Bill, is very formal and reserved with her, that he 
doesn’t talk to her or share his thinking with her, is inconsiderate, 
that they are sexually incompatible and rapidly growing apart. As 
she talks out her attitudes the picture changes rather drastically. She 
expresses the deep guilt feeling which she has regarding her life be­
fore her marriage, when she had affairs with a number of men, 
mostly married men. She realizes that though with most people 
she is a gay and spontaneous person, with her husband she is stiff, 
controlled, lacking in spontaneity. She also sees herself as demanding 
that he be exactly what she wishes him to be. A t this point coun­
seling is interrupted by the counselor’s absence from the city. She 
continues to write to the counselor expressing her feelings, and 
adding, “If I could only say these things to him (her husband) I 
could be myself at home. But what would that do to his trust in 
people? W ould you find me repulsive if you were my husband and 
learned the truth? I wish I were a ‘nice gal’ instead of a ‘Babe.* I’ve 
made such a mess of tilings.”
This is followed by a letter from which a lengthy quotation seems 
justified. She tells how irritable she has been —  how disagreeable 
she was when company dropped in one evening. After they left 
“ I felt like a louse for behaving so badly. . . .  I was still feeling 
sullen, guilty, angry at myself and Bill — and just about as blue as 
they come.
“So, I decided to do what I’ve been really wanting to do and 
putting off because I felt it was more than I could expect from any 
man — to tell Bill just what was making me act that terrible way. 
It was even harder than telling you — and that was hard enough. I 
couldn’t tell it in such minute detail but I did manage to get out 
some of those sordid feelings about my parents and then even more 
about those ‘damn’ men. The nicest thing I’ve ever heard him say 
was ‘Well, maybe I can help you there’ — when speaking of my 
parents. And he was very accepting of the things I had done. I 
told him how I felt so inadequate in so many situations — because

317
I have never been allowed to do so many things — even to know 
how to play cards. W e talked, discussed, and really got down 
deep into so many of both our feelings. I didn’t tell him as com­
pletely about the men — their names, but I did give him an idea of 
about how many. Well, he was so understanding and things have 
cleared up so much that I T R U S T  HIM. I’m not afraid now to tell 
him those silly little illogical feelings that keep popping into my 
head. And if I’m not afraid then maybe soon those silly things will 
stop popping. The other evening when I wrote to you I was almost 
ready to pull o u t— I even thought of just leaving town. (Escaping 
the whole affair.) But I realized that I’d just keep running from it 
and not be happy until it was faced. We talked over children and 
though we’ve decided to wait until Bill is closer to finishing school, 
I’m happy with this arrangement. Bill feels as I do about the things 
we want to do for our children — and most important the things we 
don't want to do to them. So if you don’t get any more desperate 
sounding letters, you know things are going along as okay as can 
be expected.
“ Now, I’m wondering — have you known all along that that was 
the only thing I could do to bring Bill and me closer? That was 
the one thing I kept telling myself wouldn’t be fair to Bill. 
I 
thought it would ruin his faith in me and in everyone. I had a 
barrier so big between Bill and me that I felt he was almost a stranger. 
The only way I pushed myself to do it was to realize that if I didn’t 
at least try his response to the things that were bothering me, it 
wouldn’t be fair to him — to leave him without giving him a chance 
to prove that he could be trusted. He proved even more than that to 
me — that he’s been down in hell too with his feelings — about his 
parents, and a good many people in general.”
I believe this letter needs no comment. It simply means to me that 
as she had experienced in therapy the satisfaction of being herself, of 
voicing her deep feelings, it became impossible for her to behave 
differently with her husband. She found that she had to be and 
express her own deepest feelings, even if this seemed to risk her 
marriage.
Another element in the experience of our clients is a somewhat 
subtle one. They find that, as in this instance, expression of feelings

318
W h a t A re t h e I m p l ic a t io n s f o r L iv in g?
is a deeply satisfying thing, where formerly it has nearly always 
seemed destructive and disastrous. The difference seems to be due 
to this fact. When a person is living behind a front, a fagade, his 
unexpressed feelings pile up to some explosion point, and are then 
apt to be triggered off by some specific incident. But the feelings 
which sweep over the person and are expressed at such a time — in 
a temper storm, in a deep depression, in a flood of self-pity, and the 
like — often have an unfortunate effect on all concerned because 
they are so inappropriate to the specific situation and hence seem so 
unreasonable. The angry flare-up over one annoyance in the re­
lationship may actually be the pent-up or denied feelings resulting 
from dozens of such situations. But in the context in which it is 
expressed it is unreasonable and hence not understood.
Here is where therapy helps to break a vicious circle. As the 
client is able to pour out, in all their accumulated anguish, fury, 
or despair, the emotions which he has been feeling, and as he ac­
cepts these feelings as his own, they lose their explosiveness. Hence 
he is more able to express, in any specific family relationship, the 
feelings aroused by that relationship. Since they do not carry such 
an overload from the past, they are more appropriate, and more 
likely to be understood. Gradually the individual finds himself ex­
pressing his feelings when they occur, not at some much later point 
after they have burned and festered in him.
R e l a t io n s h ip s C an B e L iv ed o n a R ea l B asis
There is another effect which counseling seems to hare on the way 
our clients experience their family relationships. The client discovers, 
often to his great surprise, that a relationship can be lived on the 
basis of the real feelings, rather than on the basis of a defensive 
pretense. There is a deep and comforting significance to this, as we 
have already seen in the case of Mrs. M. T o discover that feelings 
of shame and anger and annoyance can be expressed, and that the 
relationship still survives, is reassuring. T o find that one can ex­
press tenderness and sensitivity and fearfulness and yet not be be­
trayed — this is a deeply strengthening thing. It seems that part 
of the reason this works out constructively is that in therapy the 
individual learns to recognize and express his feelings as his own

319
feelings, not as a fact about another person. Thus, to say to one’s 
spouse “ What you are doing is all wrong,” is likely to lead only to 
debate. But to say “ I feel very much annoyed by what you’re do­
ing,” is to state one fact about the speaker’s feelings, a fact which 
no one can deny. It no longer is an accusation about another, but 
a feeling which exists in oneself. “ You are to blame for my feelings 
of inadequacy” is a debatable point, but “ I feel inadequate when 
you do thus and so” simply contributes a real fact about the relation­
ship.
But it is not only at the verbal level that this operates. The person 
who accepts his own feelings within himself, finds that a relationship 
can be lived on the basis of these real feelings. Let me illustrate 
this with a scries of excerpts from the recorded interviews with 
Mrs. S.
Mrs. S. lived with her ten year old daughter and her seventy year 
old mother, who dominated the household by her “poor health.” 
Mrs. S. was controlled by her mother, and unable to control her 
daughter, Carol. She felt resentful of her mother, but could not 
express this, because “ I have felt guilty all my life. I grew up feeling 
guilty because everything that I did I felt was a . . .  in some way 
affecting my mother’s health. . . .  In fact, a few years ago, it came 
to the point where I was having dreams at night about . . . shaking 
my mother and . . .  I’d . . .  I got the feeling that I just wanted to 
push her out of the way. And . . .  I can understand how Carol 
might feel. She doesn’t dare . . . and neither do I.”
Mrs. S. knows that most people think she would be much better 
off if she left her mother, but she cannot. “ I know that if I do leave 
her, that I couldn’t possibly be happy, I’d be so worried about her. 
And I’d feel so badly about leaving a poor old lady alone.”
As she complains about the extent to which she is dominated and 
controlled, she begins to see the part she is playing, a cowardly 
part. “ I feel that my hands are tied. Perhaps I’m at fault . . . more 
than mother is. In fact I know I am, but I’ve sort of becomc a 
coward where mother’s concerned. I’ll do anything to avoid one of 
the scenes that she puts on about little things.”
As she understands herself better she comes to an inward con­
clusion to try to live in the relationship according to what she be­

320
W h a t A re t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
lieves is right, rather than in terms of her mother’s wishes. She 
reports this at the beginning of an interview. “Well, I’ve made a 
stupendous discovery, that perhaps it’s been my fault entirely in 
overcompensating to mother . . .  in other words, spoiling her. So 
I made up my mind like I do every morning, but I think this time 
it’s gonna work, that I would try to . . . oh, to be calm and quiet, 
and . . .  if she does go into one of her spells, to just more or less ig­
nore it as you would a child who throws a tantrum just to get at­
tention. So I tried it. And she got angry over some little thing. 
And she jumped up from the table and went into her room. Well, 
I didn’t rush in and say, oh, I’m sorry, and beg her to come back, 
and I simply just ignored it. So in a few minutes, why, she came 
back and sat down and was a little sulky but she was over it. So 
I’m going to try that for a while an d .. . . ”
Airs. S. realizes clearly that the basis for her new behavior is that 
she has come genuinely to acccpt her own feelings toward her 
mother. She says, “Well, why not face it? You see, I’ve been feel­
ing so horrible, and thinking what a horrible person I was to resent 
my mother. Well, let’s just say, okay, I resent her; and I’m sorry; 
but let’s face it and I’ll try to make the best of it.”
As she accepts herself more she becomes much more able to 
meet some of her own needs as well as those of her mother. 
“There’s a lot of things that I’ve wanted to do for years and that 
I’m just going to start to do. Now , mother can be alone till ten 
o’clock at night there. She has a telephone by her bed and . . .  if a 
fire starts or something, there are neighbors, or if she becomes ill 
. . .  so I’m going to take some night courses through the public 
schools you know, and I’m going to do a lot of things that I’ve 
wanted to do all my life, and have sort of been a martyr in staying 
home resenting it . . . that I had to, and thinking, oh, well, and 
not doing it. Well, I’m going to now. And I think after the first 
time I go, why, she’ll be all right.”
Her new found feelings are soon put to a test in the relationship 
with her mother. “M y mother had a very severe heart attack the 
other day and I said, well, you’d better go to the hospital and . . . 
and you certainly need hospitalization; and I whipped her dow n 
to the doctor, and the doctor said her heart was fine and she oughta

get out and have a little fun. So she’s going to visit a friend for a 
week and see the shows and have a good time. So . . . actually 
when it came down to getting ready to go to the hospital, how 
cruel I am to her by contradicting her in front of Carol and all 
that sort of thing, why, then she backed down and when she was 
faced with the fact that she . . . and her heart’s just as strong as a 
bull’s, why, she thought she might as well use it to have some fun 
with. So that’s fine. W orking out fine.”
Up to this point it might seem as though the relationship had 
improved for Mrs. S., but not for her mother. There is, however, 
another side to the picture. Somewhat later Mrs. S. says “ I still am 
very, very sorry for mother. I would hate to be like she is. And 
another thing, you know, I just got to the point where I just hated 
mother; I couldn’t stand to touch her, or . . .  I mean . . . brush 
against her or something. I don’t mean, just for the moment, while 
I was angry or anything. But . ..  I’ve also found myself, oh, feeling 
a little affectionate toward her; two or three times I’ve gone in 
without even thinking, kissed her goodnight, and I used to just 
holler from the door. And . . .  I’ve been feeling kindlier toward her; 
that resentment that I’ve had is going, along with the hold that she 
had over me, you see. So . . . that, I noticed that yesterday when I 
was helping her get ready and so forth; I fixed her hair and there 
was the longest time I couldn’t stand to touch her; and I was doing 
her hair in pin curls and so forth; and I . . .  it suddenly came to me, 
well, now this doesn’t bother me a bit; in fact it’s kind of fun.”
These excerpts seem to me to portray a pattern of change in 
family relationships which is very familiar to us. Mrs. S. feels, 
though she hardly dares admit it even to herself, resentful of her 
mother and as though she had no rights of her own. It seems as 
though nothing but difficulty could result from letting these feelings 
exist openly in the relationship. Yet as she tentatively permits them 
to enter the situation she finds herself acting with more assurance, 
more integrity. The relationship improves rather than deteriorates. 
Most surprising of all, when the relationship is lived on the basis of 
the real feelings, she finds that resentment and hate are not the only 
feelings she has toward her mother. Fondness, affection and en­
joyment arc also feelings which enter the relationship. It seems clear

322
W h a t A r e t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
that there may be moments of discord, dislike, and anger between 
the two. But there will also be respect and understanding and liking. 
They seem to have learned what many other clients have also learned, 
that a relationship does not have to be lived on a basis of pretense, 
but can be lived on the basis of the fluctuating variety of feelings 
which actually exist.
It may seem, from the illustrations I have chosen, that it is only 
negative feelings which are difficult to express or live. This is far 
from true. Mr. K., a young professional man, found it fully as diffi­
cult to discover the positive feelings which lay beneath his fagade, 
as the negative. A brief excerpt will indicate the changed quality 
of his relationship with his three-year-old daughter.
He says, “ The thing that I was thinking about as I rode down 
here was — how differently I see our little girl — I was playing 
with her this morning — and —  we just, ah, well — why is it so 
hard for me to get words out now? This was a really wonderful 
experience — very warm, and it was a happy and pleasant thing, and 
it seems that I saw and felt her so close to me. Here’s what I think 
is significant— before, I could talk about Judy. I could say posi­
tive things about her and funny little things she’d do and just talk 
about her as though I were and felt like a real happy father, but 
there was some unreal quality . . .  as though I was just saying these 
things because I should be feeling this stuff and this is the way a 
father should talk about his daughter but somehow this wasn’t really 
true because I did have these negative and mixed up feelings about 
her. N ow  I do think she is the most wonderful kid in the world.”
T : “Before, you felt as though ‘I should be a happy father’ — 
this morning you are a happy father...
“It certainly felt that way this morning. She just rolled around 
on the bed . . . and then she asked me if I wanted to go to sleep 
again and I said okay and then she said well, I’ll go get my blankets 
. .  . and then she told me a story . . . about three stories in one . . . 
all jumbled up and . . .  it just felt like this is what I really want 
. . .  I want to have this experience. It felt that I was . . .  I felt 
grown up, I guess. I felt that I was a man . . . now this sounds 
strange, but it did feel as though I was a grownup responsible loving 
father, who was big enough, and serious enough, and also happy

323
enough to be the father of this child. Whereas before I did feel 
weak and maybe almost undeserving, ineligible to be that important, 
because it is a very important thing to be a father.”
He has found it possible to accept positive feelings toward himself 
as a good father, and to fully accept this warm love for his little 
girl. He no longer has to pretend he loves her, fearful that some 
different feeling may be lurking underneath.
I think it will not surprise you that shortly after this he told how 
he could be much more free in expressing anger and annoyance at 
his little daughter, also. He is learning that the feelings which exist 
are good enough to live by. They do not have to be coated with 
a veneer.
Im p r o v e m e n t in  T w o-W a y C o m m u n ic a t io n
Experience in therapy seems to bring about another change in the 
way our clients live in their family relationships. They learn some­
thing about how to initiate and maintain real two-way communi­
cation. 
T o  understand another person’s thoughts and feelings 
thoroughly, with the meanings they have for him, and to be thor­
oughly understood by this other person in return — this is one of 
the most rewarding of human experiences, and all too rare. Individ­
uals who have come to us for therapy often report their pleasure in 
discovering that such genuine communication is possible with mem­
bers of their own families.
In part this seems to be due, quite directly, to their experience of 
communication with the counselor. It is such a relief, such a blessed 
relaxation of defenses, to find oneself understood, that the individual 
wishes to create this atmosphere for others. T o  find, in the thera­
peutic relationship that one’s most awful thoughts, one’s most bizarre 
and abnormal feelings, one’s most ridiculous dreams and hopes, 
one’s most evil behaviors, can all be understood by another, is a 
tremendously releasing experience. One begins to see it as a resource 
he could extend to others.
But there appears to be an even more fundamental reason why 
these clicnts can understand members of their families. When we 
are living behind a fagade, when we are trying to act in ways that 
are not in accord with our feelings, then we dare not listen freely

324
W h a t A r e t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
to another. W e must always have our guard up, lest he pierce the 
pretense of our fagade. But when a client is living in the wav I have 
been describing, when he tends to express his real feelings in the 
situation in which they occur, when his family relationships are lived 
on the basis of the feelings which actually exist, then he is no 
longer defensive and he can really listen to, and understand, an­
other member of his family. He can let himself see how life appears 
to this other person.
Something of what I am saying may be illustrated from the ex­
perience of Mrs. S., the woman quoted in the preceding section. 
In a followup contact after the conclusion of her interviews, Mrs.
S. was asked to give some of her own reactions to her experience. 
She savs, “ I didn’t feel at first that it was counseling. You know? 
I thought, well, I’m just talking, b u t . . .  by giving it a little thought, 
I realize that it is counseling and of the very best kind, because 
I’ve had advice, and excellent advice from doctors and family and 
friends and . . . it’s never worked. And I think in order to reach 
people, you can’t put up barriers and things of that sort, because 
then you don’t get the true reaction. . . . But I’ve given it a great 
deal of thought and I’m sort of working it with Carol a little bit 
now (laughing) or trying to, you know. And . . . grandma says 
to her, how can you be so mean to your poor sick old grandmother, 
you know. And I just know how Carol feels. She just wants to hit 
her because she’s so terrible! But I sort of haven’t been saying too 
much to Carol or trying to guide her. But I’ve been trying to 
draw her out . . . lcr her feel that I’m with her and behind her, no 
matter what she does. And let her tell me how she feels, and her 
little reactions to things, and it’s working out fine. She has told 
me, oh, grandma’s been old and sick for so long, mother. And I 
said, yes. And I don’t condemn her nor do I praise her, and so she 
is, just in this short time beginning to . . . oh, get little things off 
her mind and . . . without my probing or trying to . . .  so it’s sort 
of working on her. And it seems to be working on mother a little 
bit too.”
I think we may say of Airs. S. that having accepted her own feel­
ings, and having been more willing to express them and to live in 
them, she now finds more willingness on her own part to understand

Implications of Client-Centered Therapy
325
her daughter and her mother, nnd to feel empathically their own 
reactions to life. She is sufficiently free of defensiveness to be able 
to listen in an accepting manner, and to sense the way life feels 
to them. This kind of development seems characteristic of the 
change which occurs in the family life of our clients.
W il l in g n e s s fo r A n o t h er to b e S fp a r a t e
There is one final tendency which we have noticed and which 
I would like to describe. It is quite noticeable that our clients tend 
in the direction of permitting each member of the family to have 
his own feelings and to be a separate person. This may seem a 
strange statement, but it is actually a most radical step. Many of 
us are perhaps unaware of the tremendous pressure we tend to put 
on our wives, our husbands, our children, to have the same feel­
ings we do. It is often as though we said, “ If you want me to love 
you, then you must have the same feelings I do. If I feel your 
behavior is bad, you must feel so too. If I feel a certain goal is 
desirable, you must feel so too.” N ow  the tendency which we see 
in our clients is the opposite of this. There is a willingness for the 
other person to have different feelings, different values, different 
goals. In short, there is a willingness for him to be a separate per­
son.
It is my belief that this tendency develops as the person discovers 
that he can trust his own feelings and reactions — that his own deep 
impulses are not destructive or catastrophic, and that he himself 
need not be guarded, but can meet life on a real basis. As he thus 
learns that he can trust himself, with his own uniqueness, he becomes 
more able to trust his wife, or his child, and to accept the unique 
feelings and values which exist in this other person.
Something of what I mean is contained in letters from a woman 
and her husband. They are friends of mine and had obtained a 
copy of a book I had written because they were interested in what 
I was doing. But the effcct of the book seemed to be similar to 
therapy. The wife wrote me and included in her letter a para­
graph giving her reactions. “ Lest you think that we are completely 
frivolous, we have been reading Client-Centered Therapy. I have 
almost finished it. Most of the usual things you say about books

don’t apply, at least for me. In fact it was pretty close to a coun­
seling experience. It set me to thinking about some of the un­
satisfactory relationships in our family, particularly my attitude 
toward Phillip (her 14-vear-old son). I realized that I hadn’t shown 
him any real love for a long time, because I was so resentful of 
his apparent indifference in trying to measure up to any of the 
standards that I have always thought were important. Since I have 
stopped taking most of the responsibility for his goals, and have 
responded to him as a person, as I always have to Nancy, for in­
stance, it is surprising what changes have appeared in his attitudes. 
N ot earth-shaking — but a heartwarming beginning. We no longer 
heckle him about his school work, and the other day he volunteered 
that he had gotten an S — satisfactory grade — on a math exam. 
The first time this year.”
A few months later I heard from her husband. “You wouldn’t 
recognize Phil. . . . While he is hardly garrulous, he is not nearly 
the sphinx that he was, and he is doing much better in school, al­
though we do not expect him to be graduated cum laudc. You 
should take a great deal of credit for his improvement, because he 
began to blossom when I finally began to trust him to be himself, 
and ceased trying to mold him into the glorified image of his father 
at a similar age. Oh to undo our past errors!”
This concept of trusting the individual to be himself has come to 
have a great deal of meaning to me. I sometimes fantasy about what 
it would mean if a child were treated in this fashion from the first. 
Suppose a child were permitted to have his own unique feelings — 
suppose he never had to disown his feelings in order to be loved. 
Suppose his parents were free to have and express their own unique 
feelings, which often would be different from his, and often dif­
ferent between themselves. I like to think of all the meanings that 
such an experience would have. It would mean that the child would 
grow up respecting himself as a unique person. It would mean that 
even when his behavior had to be thwarted, he could retain open 
“ownership” of his feelings. It would mean that his behavior would 
be a realistic balance, taking into account his own feelings and the 
known and open feelings of others. He would, I believe, be a re­
sponsible and self-directing individual, who would never need to

conceal his feelings from himself, who would never need to live 
behind a fagade. He would be relatively free of the maladjust­
ments which cripple so many of us.
T h e  G e n e r a l  P i c t u r e
If I have been able correctly to discern the trends in the experience 
of our clients, then client-centered therapy seems to have a number 
of implications for family life. Let me attempt to restate these in 
somew hat more general form.
It appears that an individual finds it satisfying in the long run 
to express any strong or persistent emotional attitudes in the situa­
tion in w hich they arise, to the person with whom they are con­
cerned, and to the depth to which they exist. This is more satisfy­
ing than refusing to admit that such feelings exist, or permitting 
them to pile up to an explosive degree, or directing them toward 
some situation other than the one in which they arose.
It seems that the individual discovers that it is more satisfying in 
the long run to live a given family relationship on the basis of the 
real interpersonal feelings which exist, rather than living the re­
lationship on the basis of a pretense. A part of this discovery is that 
the fear that the relationship will be destroyed if the true feelings 
are admitted, is usually unfounded, particularly when the feelings are 
expressed as belonging to oneself, not as stating something about 
the other person.
Our clients find that as they express themselves more freely, as 
the surface character of the relationship matches more closely the 
fluctuating attitudes which underlie it, they can lay aside some of 
their defenses and truly listen to the other person. Often for the 
first time they begin to understand how the other person feels, and 
why he feels that wav. Thus mutual understanding begins to per­
vade the interpersonal interaction.
Finally, there is an increasing willingness for the other person to 
be himself. As I am more willing to be myself, I find I am more 
ready to permit vou to be yourself, with all that that implies. This 
means that the family circle tends in the direction of becoming a 
number of separate and unique persons with individual goals and 
values, but bound together by the real feelings — positive and

328
W h a t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
negative — which exist between them, and by the satisfying bond 
of mutual understanding of at least a portion of each other’s private 
worlds.
It is in these ways, I believe, that a therapy which results in the 
individual becoming more fully and more deeply himself, results 
also in his finding greater satisfaction in realistic family relation­
ships which likewise promote the same end — that of facilitating 
each member of the family in the process of discovering, and be­
coming, himself.

providing therapeutic help to individuals with emotional malad­
justments and the concern of this conference with obstacles to com­
munication? Actually the relationship is very close indeed. The 
whole task of psychotherapy is the task of dealing with a failure in 
communication. The emotionally maladjusted person, the “ neu­
rotic,” is in difficulty first, because communication within himself 
has broken down, and second because, as a result of this, his com­
munication with others has been damaged. If this sounds somewhat 
strange to you, then let me put it in other terms. In the “ neurotic” 
individual, parts of himself which have been termed unconscious, or 
repressed, or denied to awareness, become blocked off so that they 
no longer communicate themselves to the conscious or managing 
part of himself. As long as this is true, there are distortions in the 
way he communicates himself to others, and so he suffers both 
within himself, and in his interpersonal relations. 
The task of 
psychotherapy is to help the person achieve, through a special re­
lationship with a therapist, good communication within himself. 
Once this is achieved he can communicate more freely and more 
effectively with others. Wre may say then that psychotherapy is 
good communication, within and between men. We may also turn 
that statement around and it will still be true. Good communica­
tion, free communication, within or between men, is always thera­
peutic.
It is, then, from a background of experience with communication 
in counseling and psychotherapy, that I want to present to you 
tonight two ideas. I wish to state what I believe is one of the major 
factors in blocking or impeding communication, and then I wish 
to present what in our experience has proven to be a very important 
way of improving or facilitating communication.
I would like to propose, as an hypothesis for consideration, that 
the major barrier to mutual interpersonal communication is our very 
natural tendency to judge, to evaluate, to approve or disapprove, the 
statement of the other person, or the other group. Let me illustrate 
my meaning with some very simple examples. As you leave the 
meeting tonight, one of the statements you are likely to hear is, “I 
didn’t like that man’s talk.” N ow  what do you respond? Almost 
invariably your reply will be either approval or disapproval of the

Breakdowns m Communication
331
attitude expressed. Either you respond, “ I didn’t either. I thought 
it was terrible,” or else you tend to reply, “Oh, I thought it was 
really good.” In other words, your primary reaction is to evaluate 
what has just been said to you, to evaluate it from your point of 
view, your own frame of reference.
Or take another example. Suppose I say with some feeling, “ I 
think the Republicans are behaving in ways that show a lot of good 
sound sense these days,” what is the response that arises in your mind 
as you listen? The overwhelming likelihood is that it will be evalua­
tive. You will find yourself agreeing, or disagreeing, or making 
some judgment about me such as “ He must be a conservative,” or 
“ He seems solid in his thinking.” Or let us take an illustration from 
the international scene. Russia says vehemently, “The treaty with 
Japan is a war plot on the part of the United States.” W e rise as 
one person to say “That’s a lie!”
This last illustration brings in another element connected with my 
hypothesis. Although the tendency to make evaluations is common 
in almost all interchange of language, it is very much heightened in 
those situations where feelings and emotions are deeply involved. So 
the stronger our feelings the more likely it is that there will be no 
mutual element in the communication. There will be just two ideas, 
two feelings, two judgments, missing each other in psychological 
space. I’m sure you recognize this from your own experience. When 
you have not been emotionally involved yourself, and have listened 
to a heated discussion, you often go away thinking, “ Well, they 
actually weren’t talking about the same thing.” And they were not. 
Each was making a judgment, an evaluation, from his own frame of 
reference. There was really nothing which could be called communi­
cation in any genuine sense. This tendency to react to any emo­
tionally meaningful statement by forming an evaluation of it from 
our own point of view, is, I repeat, the major barrier to interpersonal 
communication.
But is there any way of solving this problem, of avoiding this 
barrier? I feel that we are making exciting progress toward this goal 
and I would like to present it as simply as I can. Real communication 
occurs, and this evaluative tendency is avoided, when we listen with 
understanding. W hat does this mean? It means to see the expressed

332
VViia t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
idea and attitude from the other person’s point of view, to sense how 
it feels to him, to achieve his frame of reference in regard to the thing 
he is talking about.
Stated so briefly, this may sound absurdly simple, but it is not 
It is an approach which we have found extremely potent in the field 
of psychotherapy. It is the most effective agent we know for alter­
ing the basic personality structure of an individual, and improving 
his relationships and his communications with others. If I can listen 
to what he can tell me, if I can understand how it seems to him, if I 
can see its personal meaning for him, if I can sense the emotional 
flavor which it has for him, then I will be releasing potent forces of 
change in him. If I can really understand how he hates his father, or 
hates the university, or hates communists — if I can catch the flavor 
of his fear of insanity, or his fear of atom bombs, or of Russia — it 
will be of the greatest help to him in altering those very hatreds and 
fears, and in establishing realistic and harmonious relationships with 
the very people and situations toward which he has felt hatred and 
fear. W e know from our research that such empathic understand­
ing — understanding 'with a person, not about him — is such an effec­
tive approach that it can bring about major changes in personality.
Some of you may be feeling that you listen well to people, and 
that you have never seen such results. The chances are very great 
indeed that your listening has not been of the type I have described. 
Fortunately I can suggest a little laboratory experiment which you 
can try to test the quality of your understanding. The next time 
you get into an argument with your wife, or your friend, or with a 
small group of friends, just stop the discussion for a moment and for 
an experiment, institute this rule. “Each person can speak up for 
himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the 
previous speaker accurately, and to that speaker’s satisfaction.” You 
see what this would mean. It would simply mean that before pre­
senting your own point of view, it would be necessary for you to 
really achieve the other speaker’s frame of reference —  to under­
stand his thoughts and feelings so well that you could summarize 
them for him. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? But if you try it you will 
discover it is one of the most difficult things you have ever tried to 
do. However, once you have been able to see the other’s point of

Breakdowns in Conmmmcation
333
view, your own comments will have to be drastically revised. You 
will also find the emotion going out of the discussion, the differences 
being reduced, and those differences which remain being of a ra­
tional and understandable sort.
Can you imagine what this kind of an approach would mean if it 
were projected into larger areas? W hat would happen to a labor- 
management dispute if it was conducted in such a way that labor, 
without necessarily agreeing, could accuratcly state management’s 
point of view in a way that management could accept; and manage­
ment, without approving labor’s stand, could state labor’s case in a 
way that labor agreed was accurate? It would mean that real com­
munication was established, and one could practically guarantee that 
some reasonable solution would be reached.
If then this way of approach is an effective avenue to good com­
munication and good relationships, as I am quite sure you will agree 
if you try the experiment I have mentioned, why is it not more 
w idely tried and used? I will try to list the difficulties which keep it 
from being utilized.
In the first place it takes courage, a quality which is not too wide­
spread. I am indebted to Dr. S. I. Hayakawa, the semanticist, for 
pointing out that to carry on psychotherapy in this fashion is to take 
a very real risk, and that courage is required. If you really under­
stand another person in this way, if you are willing to enter his pri­
vate world and see the way life appears to him, without any attempt 
to make evaluative judgments, you run the risk of being changed 
yourself. You might see it his way, you might find yourself in­
fluenced in your attitudes or your personality. This risk of being 
changed is one of the most frightening prospects most of us can 
face. If 1
 enter, as fully as I am able, into the private world of a 
neurotic or psychotic individual, isn’t there a risk that I might be­
come lost in that world? Most of us are afraid to take that risk. Or 
if we had a Russian communist speaker here tonight, or Senator 
Joseph McCarthy, how many of us would dare to try to sec the world 
from each of these points of view? The great majority of us could 
not listen; we would find ourselves compelled to evaluate, because 
listening would seem too dangerous. So the first requirement is 
courage, and we do not always have it.

334
W h a t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
But there is a second obstacle. It is just when emotions are 
strongest that it is most difficult to achieve the frame of reference of 
the other person or group. Yet this is the time the attitude is most 
needed, if communication is to be established. W e have not found 
this to be an insuperable obstacle in our experience in psychotherapy. 
A third party, who is able to lay aside his own feelings and evalua­
tions, can assist greatly by listening with understanding to each per­
son or group and clarifying the views and attitudes each holds. W e 
have found this very effective in small groups in which contradic­
tory or antagonistic attitudes exist. When the parties to a dispute 
realize that they are being understood, that someone sees how the 
situation seems to them, the statements grow less exaggerated and 
less defensive, and it is no longer necessary to maintain the attitude, 
“I am 100 per cent right and you are 100 per cent wrong.” The 
influence of such an understanding catalyst in the group permits the 
members to come closer and closer to the objective truth involved in 
the relationship. In this way mutual communication is established 
and some type of agreement becomes much more possible. So we 
may say that though heightened emotions make it much more diffi­
cult to understand 'with an opponent, our experience makes it clear 
that a neutral, understanding, catalyst type of leader or therapist 
can overcome this obstacle in a small group.
This last phrase, however, suggests another obstacle to utilizing 
the approach I have described. Thus far all our experience has been 
with small face-to-face groups — groups exhibiting industrial ten­
sions, religious tensions, racial tensions, and therapy groups in which 
many personal tensions are present. In these small groups our experi­
ence, confirmed by a limited amount of research, shows that a lis­
tening, empathic approach leads to improved communication, to 
greater acceptance of others and by others, and to attitudes which 
are more positive and more problem-solving in nature. There is a 
decrease in defensiveness, in exaggerated statements, in evaluative 
and critical behavior. But these findings are from small groups. 
W hat about trying to achieve understanding between larger groups 
that are geographically remote? Or between face-to-face groups 
who are not speaking for themselves, but simply as representatives 
of others, like the delegates at the United Nations? Frankly we do

Breakdowns in Communication
335
not know the answers to these questions. I jelieve the situation 
might be put this way. As social scientists we have a tentative test- 
tube solution of the problem of breakdown in communication. But 
to confirm the validity of this test-tube solution, and to adapt it to 
the enormous problems of communication breakdown between 
classes, groups, and nations, would involve additional funds, much 
more research, and creative thinking of a high order.
Even with our present limited knowledge we can see some steps 
which might be taken, even in large groups, to increase the amount 
of listening with, and to decrease the amount of evaluation about. 
T o be imaginative for a moment, let us suppose that a therapeutically 
oriented international group went to the Russian leaders and said, 
“We want to achieve a genuine understanding of your views and 
even more important, of your attitudes and feelings, toward the 
United States. W e will summarize and resummarize these views 
and feelings if necessary, until you agree that our description repre­
sents the situation as it seems to you.” Then suppose they did the 
same thing with the leaders in our own country. If they then gave 
the widest possible distribution to these two views, with the feelings 
clearly described but not expressed in name-calling, might not the 
effect be very great? It would not guarantee the type of under­
standing I have been describing, but it would make it much more 
possible. W e can understand the feelings of a person who hates us 
much more readily when his attitudes are accurately described to 
us by a neutral third party, than we can when he is shaking his 
fist at us.
But even to describe such a first step is to suggest another obstacle 
to this approach of understanding. Our civilization does not yet 
have enough faith in the social sciences to utilize their findings. The 
opposite is true of the physical sciences. During the war when a 
test-tube solution was found to the problem of synthetic rubber, 
millions of dollars and an army of talent was turned loose on the 
problem of using that finding. If synthetic rubber could be made in 
milligrams, it could and would be made in the thousands of tons. 
And it was. But in the social science realm, if a way is found of 
facilitating communication and mutual understanding in small 
groups, there is no guarantee that the finding will be utilized. It

336
W h a t A re t h e I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
nmy be a generation or more before the money and the brains will be 
turned loose to exploit that finding.
In closing, 1
 would like to summarize this small-scale solution to 
the problem of barriers in communication, and to point out certain 
of its characteristics.
I have said that our research and experience to date would make 
it appear that breakdowns in communication, and the evaluative 
tendency which is the major barrier to communication, can be 
avoided. The solution is provided by creating a situation in which 
each of the different parties comes to understand the other from the 
other's point of view. This has been achieved, in practice, even 
when feelings run high, by the influence of a person who is willing 
to understand each point of view empathically, and who thus acts 
as a catalyst to precipitate further understanding.
This procedure has important characteristics. It can be initiated 
by one party, without waiting for the other to be ready. It can even 
be initiated by a neutral third person, providing he can gain a mini­
mum of cooperation from one of the parties.
This procedure can deal with the insincerities, the defensive exag­
gerations, the lies, the “false fronts” which characterize almost every 
failure in communication. These defensive distortions drop away 
with astonishing speed as people find that the only intent is to un­
derstand, not judge.
This approach leads steadily and rapidly toward the discovery 
of the truth, toward a realistic appraisal of the objective barriers 
to communication. The dropping of some defensiveness by one 
party leads to further dropping of defensiveness by the other party, 
and truth is thus approached.
This procedure gradually achieves mutual communication. Mutual 
communication tends to be pointed toward solving a problem rather 
than toward attacking a person or group. It leads to a situation in 
which I see how the problem appears to you, as well as to me, and 
you see how it appears to me, as well as to you. Thus accurately 
and realistically defined, the problem is almost certain to yield to 
intelligent attack, or if it is in part insoluble, it will be comfortably 
accepted as such.
This then appears to be a test-tube solution to the breakdown of

Breakdowns in Communication
337
communication as it occurs in small groups. Can we take this small 
scale answer, investigate it further, refine it, develop it and apply 
it to the tragic and well-nigh fatal failures of communication which 
threaten the very existence of our modern world? It seems to me 
that this is a possibility and a challenge which we should explore.

uring a recent summer 1 gave some thought to a theoretical 
proble?n which had tantalized me: Would it be possible to 
formulate, in one hypothesis, the elements which make any relation­
ship either growth-facilitating or the reverse. I worked out a short 
document for myself, and had occasion to try it out on a workshop 
group and some industrial executives with whom I was conferring. 
It seemed to be of interest to all, but most stimulating to the industrial 
leaders who discussed it pro and con in terms of such problems as: 
supervisor-supervisee relationships; labor-management relationships; 
executive training; interpersonal relations among top management.
1 regard this as a highly tentative document, and am not at all sure 
of its adequacy. I include it because many who have read it have 
found it provocative, and because publication of it may inspire re­
search studies which would begin to test its validity.

I
 h a v e  m a n y  t i m e s  a s k e d  myself how our learnings in the field of 
psychotherapy apply to human relationships in general. During 
recent years I have thought much about this issue and attempted to 
338

A General Law of Interpersonal Relationships
339
state a theory of interpersonal relationships as a part of the larger 
structure of theory in client-ccntered therapy (1, Sec. IV ). 
This 
present document undertakes to spell out, in a somewhat different 
way, one of the aspects of that theory. It endeavors to look at a 
perccived underlying orderliness in all human relationships, an order 
which determines whether the relationship will make for the growth, 
enhancement, openness, and development of both individuals or 
whether it will make for inhibition of psychological growth, for 
defensiveness and blockage in both parties.
T h e  C o n c e p t  o f  C o n g r u e n c e
Fundamental to much of what I wish to say is the term “congru­
ence.” This construct has been developed to cover a group of 
phenomena which seem important to therapy and to all interpersonal 
interaction. I would like to try to define it.
Congruence is the term we have used to indicate an accurate 
matching of experiencing and awareness. It may be still further 
extended to cover a matching of experience, awareness, and com­
munication. Perhaps the simplest example is an infant. If he is ex­
periencing hunger at the physiological and visceral level, then his 
awareness appears to match this experience, and his communication 
is also congruent with his experience. He is hungry and dissatisfied, 
and this is true of him at all levels. He is at this moment integrated 
or unified in being hungry. On the other hand if he is satiated and 
content this too is a unified congruence, similar at the visceral level, 
the level of awareness and the level of communication. He is one 
unified person all the way through, whether we tap his experience 
at the visceral level, the level of his awareness, or the level of com­
munication. Probably one of the reasons why most people respond 
to infants is that they are so completely genuine, integrated or 
congruent. If an infant expresses affection or anger or contentment 
or fear there is no doubt in our minds that he is this experience, all 
the way through. He is transparently fearful or loving or hungry or 
whatever.
For an example of incongruence we must turn to someone be­
yond the stage of infancy. T o  pick an easily recognizable example 
take the man who becomes angrily involved in a group discussion. 
His face flushes, his tone communicates anger, he shakes his finger

340
W h a t A re t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
at his opponent. Yet when a friend says, “ Well, let’s not get angry 
about this,” he replies, with evident sincerity and surprise, “I’m not 
angrv! I don’t have any feeling about this at all! I was just pointing 
out the logical facts.” The other men in the group break out in 
laughter at this statement.
Whnt is happening here? It seems clear that at a physiological 
level he is experiencing anger. This is not matched by his awareness. 
Consciously he is not experiencing anger, nor is he communicating 
this (so far as he is consciously aware). There is a real incongruence 
between experience and awareness, and between experience and 
communication.
Another point to be noted here is that his communication is 
actually ambiguous and unclear. In its words it is a setting forth 
of logic and fact. In its tone, and in the accompanying gestures, it 
is carrying a very different message — “ I am angry at you.” I be­
lieve this ambiguity or contradictorincss of communication is always 
present when a person who is at that moment incongruent endeavors 
to communicate.
Still another facet of the concept of incongruence is illustrated 
by this example. The individual himself is not a sound judge of his 
own degree of congruence. Thus the laughter of the group indi­
cates a dear consensual judgment that the man is experiencing anger, 
whether or not he thinks so. Yet in his own awareness this is not true. 
In other words it appears that the degree of congruence cannot he 
evaluated by the person himself at that moment. W e may make 
progress in learning to measure it from an external frame of refer­
ence. W e have also learned much about incongruence from the 
person’s own ability to recognize incongruence in himself in the past. 
Thus if the man of our example were in therapy, he might look back 
on this incident in the acceptant safety of the therapeutic hour and 
say, “ I realize now I was terribly angry at him, even though at the 
time I thought I was not.” He has, we say, come to recognize that 
his defensiveness at that moment kept him from being aware of his 
anger.
One more example will portray another aspect of incongruence. 
Mrs. Brown, who has been stifling yawns and looking at her watch 
for hours, says to her hostess on departing, “ I enjoyed this evening

A General Law of Interpersonal Relationships
341
so much. It was a delightful party.” Here the incongruence is not 
between experience and awareness. Mrs. Browrn is well aware that 
she is bored. The incongrucncc is between awareness and communi­
cation. Thus it might be noted that when there is an incongrucnce 
between experience and awareness, it is usually spoken of as dcfcn- 
sivenessr or denial to awareness. When the incongruence is between 
awareness and communication it is usually thought of as falseness or 
deceit.
There is an important corollary of the construct of congruence 
which is not at all obvious. It may be stated in this way. If an 
individual is at this moment entirely congruent, his actual physiolog­
ical experience being accurately represented in his awareness, and 
his communication being accurately congruent with his awareness, 
then his communication could never contain an expression of an 
external fact. If he was congruent he could not say, “That rock is 
hard” ; “ He is stupid” ; “You are bad” ; or “ She is intelligent.” The 
reason for this is that wc never experience such “ facts.” Accurate 
awareness of experience would always be expressed as feelings, per­
ceptions, meanings from an internal frame of reference. I never 
know that he is stupid or you are bad. I can only pcrceive that you 
seem this way to me. Likewise, strictly speaking I do not know 
that the rock is hard, even though I may be very sure that I experi­
ence it as hard if I fall down on it. (And even then I can permit 
the physicist to perceive it as a very permeable mass of high-speed 
atoms and molecules.) If the person is thoroughly congruent then 
it is clear that all of his communication would necessarily be put in 
a context of personal perception. This has very important impli­
cations.
As an aside it might be mentioned that for a person always to 
speak from a context of personal perception does not necessarily 
imply congruence, since any mode of expression may be used as a 
type of defensiveness. Thus the person in a moment of congruence 
would necessarily communicate his perceptions and feelings as being 
these, and not as being facts about another person or the outside 
world. The reverse does not necessarily hold, however.
Perhaps I have said enough to indicate that this concept of con­
gruence is a somewhat complex concept with a number of character­

342
W h a t A r e t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
istics and implications. It is not easily defined in operational terms, 
though some studies have been completed and others arc in process 
which do provide crude operational indicators of what is being 
experienced, as distinct from the awareness of that experience. It is 
believed that further refinements are possible.
T o  conclude our definition of this construct in a much more 
commonsense way, I believe all of us tend to recognize congruence 
or incongruence in individuals with whom we deal. With some in­
dividuals we realize that in most areas this person not only con­
sciously means exactly what he says, but that his deepest feelings also 
match what he is expressing, whether it is anger or competitiveness 
or affection or cooperativcncss. W e feel that “ we know exactly 
where he stands.” W ith another individual we recognize that what 
he is saying is almost certainly a front, a facade. W e wonder what 
he really feels. W e wonder if he knows what he feels. We tend to 
be wary and cautious with such an individual.
Obviously then different individuals differ in their degree of con­
gruence, and the same individual differs at different moments in de­
gree of congruence, depending on what he is experiencing and 
whether he can accept this experience in his awareness, or must 
defend himself against it.

Perhaps the significance of this concept for interpersonal inter­
action can be recognized if we make a few statements about a hypo­
thetical Smith and Jones.
1. Any communication of Smith to Jones is marked by some de­
gree of congruence in Smith. This is obvious from the above.
2. The greater the congruence of experience, awareness, and com­
munication in Smith, the more it is likely that Jones will experience 
it as a clear communication. I believe this has been adequately cov­
ered. If all the cues from speech, tone and gesture are unified 
because they spring from a congruence and unity in Smith, then 
there is much less likelihood that these cues will have an ambiguous 
or unclear meaning to Jones.
3. Consequently, the more clear the communication from Smith, 
the more Jones responds with clarity. This is simply saying that

A General Law of Interpersonal Relationships
343
even though Jones might be quite mcongruent in his experiencing 
of the topic under discussion, nevertheless his response will have 
more clarity and congruence in it than if he had experienced Smith’s 
communication as ambiguous.
4. The more that Smith is congruent in the topic about which 
they are communicating, the less he has to defend himself against in 
this area, and the more able he is to listen accurately to Jones’ 
response. Putting it in other terms, Smith has expressed what he 
genuinely feels. He is therefore more free to listen. The less he is 
presenting a facade to be defended, the more he can listen accurately 
to what Jones is communicating.
5. But to this degree, then, Jones feels empathically understood. 
He feels that in so far as he has expressed himself, (and whether 
this is defensively or congruently) Smith has understood him pretty 
much as he sees himself, and as he perceives the topic under con­
sideration.
6. For Jones to feel understood is for him to experience positive 
regard for Smith. T o feel that one is understood is to feel that one 
has made some kind of a positive difference in the experience of 
another, in this case of Smith.
7. But to the degree that Jones (a) experiences Smith as con­
gruent or integrated in this relationship; (b) experiences Smith as 
having positive regard for him; (c) experiences Smith as being em­
pathically understanding; to that degree the conditions of a thera­
peutic relationship are established. I have tried in another paper (2) 
to describe the conditions which our experience has led us to believe 
are necessary and sufficient for therapy, and will not repeat that 
description here.
8. T o the extent that Jones is experiencing these characteristics 
of a therapeutic relationship, he finds himself experiencing fewer 
barriers to communication. Hence he tends to communicate him­
self more as he is, more congruently. Little by little his defensiveness 
decreases.
9. Having communicated himself more freely, with less of de­
fensiveness, Jones is now more able to listen accurately, without a 
need for defensive distortion, to Smith’s further communication. 
This is a repetition of step 4, but now in terms of Jones.
10. T o the degree that Jones is able to listen, Smith now feels

344
W h a t A re t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
empathically understood (as in step 5 for Jones); experiences Jones’ 
positive regard (a parallel to step 6); and finds himself experiencing 
the relationship as therapeutic (in a way parallel to step 7). Thus 
Smith and Jones have to some degree become reciprocally thera­
peutic for each other.
11. This means that to some degree the process of therapy occurs 
in each and that the outcomes of therapy will to that same degree 
occur in each; change in personality in the direction of greater 
unity and integration; less conflict and more energy utilizable for 
effective living; change in behavior in the direction of greater 
maturity.
12. The limiting element in this chain of events appears to be the 
introduction of threatening material. Thus if Jones in step 3 in­
cludes in his more congruent response new material which is outside 
of the realm of Smith’s congruence, touching an area in which 
Smith is mcongruent, then Smith may not be able to listen accu­
rately, he defends himself against hearing what Jones is communicat­
ing, he responds with communication which is ambiguous, and the 
whole process described in these steps begins to occur in reverse.
A T e n t a t iv e  S t a t e m e n t  o f  a G e n e r a l  L a w  
Taking all of the above into account, it seems possible to state it 
far more parsimoniously as a generalized principle. Here is such an 
attempt.
Assuming (a) a minimal willingness on the part of two people to 
be in contact; (b) an ability and minimal willingness on the part of 
each to receive communication from the other; and (c) assuming 
the contact to continue over a period of time; then the following 
relationship is hypothesized to hold true.
The greater the congruence of experience, awareness and com­
munication on the part of one individual, the more the ensuing 
relationship will involve: a tendency toward reciprocal communi­
cation with a quality of increasing congruence; a tendency toward 
more mutually accurate understanding of the communications; 
improved psychological adjustment and functioning in both par­
ties; mutual satisfaction in the relationship.

A General Law of Interpersonal Relationships
345
Conversely the greater the communicated incongruence of ex­
perience and awareness, the more the ensuing relationship will 
involve: further communication with the same quality; disintegra­
tion of accurate understanding, less adequate psychological adjust­
ment and functioning in both parties; and mutual dissatisfaction 
in the relationship.
W ith probably even greater formal accuracy this general law 
could be stated in a way which recognizes that it is the perception 
of the receiver of communication which is crucial. Thus the hy­
pothesized law could be put in these terms, assuming the same 
pre-conditions as before as to willingness to be in contact, etc.
The more that Y experiences the communication of X  as a con­
gruence of experience, awareness, and communication, the more 
the ensuing relationship will involve: (etc, as stated above.)
Stated in this way this “ law” becomes an hypothesis which it 
should be possible to put to test, since Y ’s perception of X ’s commu­
nication should not be too difficult to measure.
T h e  E x i s t e n t i a l  C h o ic e  
Very tentatively indeed I would like to set forth one further as­
pect of this whole matter, an aspect which is frequently very real 
in the therapeutic relationship, and also in other relationships, 
though perhaps less sharply noted.
In the actual relationship both the client and the therapist are 
frequently faced with the existential choice, “Do I dare to communi­
cate the full degree of congruence which I feel? Do I dare match 
my experience, and my awareness of that experience, with my com­
munication? Do I dare to communicate myself as I am or must my 
communication be somewhat less than or different from this?” The 
sharpness of this issue lies in the often vividly foreseen possibility 
of threat or rejection. T o communicate one’s full awareness of the 
relevant experience is a risk in interpersonal relationships. It seems 
to me that it is the taking or not taking of this risk which determines 
whether a given relationship becomes more and more mutually 
therapeutic or whether it leads in a disintegrative direction.

346
W h a t A r e t h e  Im p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
T o put it another way. I cannot choose whether my awareness 
will be congruent with my experience. This is answered by my 
need for defense, and of this I am not aware. But there is a con­
tinuing existential choice as to whether my communication will be 
congruent with the awareness I do have of what I am experiencing. 
In this moment-by-moment choice in a relationship may lie the 
answer as to whether the movement is in one direction or the other in 
terms of this hypothesized law.

Toward a Theory of 
Creativity
I
n December 1952 a Conference on Creativity was called together,
 
by invitation, by a sponsoring group from Ohio State University. 
The artist, the writer, the dancer, the musician were all represented, 
as well as educators in these various fields. In addition there were 
those who were interested in the creative process: philosophers, 
psychiatrists, psychologists. It was a vital and nourishing conference, 
and led me to produce some rough notes on creativity and the ele­
ments which might foster it. These were later expanded into the 
following paper.

I
 m a i n t a i n  that there is a desperate social need for the creative 
behavior of creative individuals. It is this which justifies the 
setting forth of a tentative theory of creativity — the nature of the 
creative act, the conditions under which it occurs, and the manner 
in which it may constructively be fostered. Such a theory may 
serve as a stimulus and guide to research studies in this field.

W h a t A r e t h e Im p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g:
T h e  S o cia l N eed
Many of the serious criticisms of our culture and its trends may 
best be formulated in terms of a dearth of creativity. Let us state 
some of these very briefly:
In education we tend to turn out conformists, stereotypes, in­
dividuals whose education is “completed,” rather than freely creative 
and original thinkers.
In our leisure time activities, passive entertainment and regimented 
group action are overwhelmingly predominant while creative ac­
tivities are much less in evidence.
In the sciences, there is an ample supply of technicians, but the 
number who can creatively formulate fruitful hypotheses and 
theories is small indeed.
In industry, creation is reserved for the few — the manager, the 
designer, the head of the research department — while for the many 
life is devoid of original or creative endeavor.
In individual and family life the same picture holds true. In the 
clothes we wear, the food we eat, the books we read, and the ideas 
we hold, there is a strong tendency toward conformity, toward 
stereotypy. T o be original, or different, is felt to be “ dangerous.” 
W hy be concerned over this? If, as a people, we enjoy conform­
ity rather than creativity, shall we not be permitted this choice? In 
my estimation such a choice would be entirely reasonable were 
it not for one great shadow which hangs over all of us. In a time 
wrhen knowledge, constructive and destructive, is advancing by 
the most incredible leaps and bounds into a fantastic atomic age, 
genuinely creative adaptation seems to represent the only possibility 
that man can keep abreast of the kaleidoscopic change in his world. 
With scientific discovery and invention proceeding, we are told, at 
the rate of geometric progression, a generally passive and culture- 
bound people cannot cope with the multiplying issues and prob­
lems. Unless individuals, groups, and nations can imagine, construct, 
and creatively revise new ways of relating to these complex changes, 
the lights will go out. Unless man can make new and original adap­
tations to his environment as rapidly as his science can change the 
environment, our culture will perish. N ot only individual malad­

349
justment and group tensions, but international annihilation will be 
the price we pay for a lack of creativity.
Consequently it would seem to me that investigations of the proc­
ess of creativity, the conditions under which this process occurs, 
and the ways in which it may be facilitated, are of the utmost im­
portance.
It is in the hope of suggesting a conceptual structure under which 
such investigations might go forward, that the following sections 
are offered.
T iie C r e a tiv e P r o cess
There are various ways of defining creativity. In order to make 
more clear the meaning of what is to follow, let me present the ele­
ments which, for me, are a part of the creative proccss, and then 
attempt a definition.
In the first place, for me as scientist, there must be something 
observable, some product of creation. Though my fantasies may be 
extremely novel, they cannot usefully be defined as creative unless 
they eventuate in some observable product — unless they are sym­
bolized in words, or written in a poem, or translated into a work of 
art, or fashioned into an invention.
These products must be novel constructions. This novelty grows 
out of the unique qualities of the individual in his interaction with 
the materials of experience. Creativity always has the stamp of the 
individual upon its product, but the product is not the individual, 
nor his materials, but partakes of the relationship between the 
two.
Creativity is not, in my judgment, restricted to some particular 
content. I am assuming that there is no fundamental difference in 
the creative process as it is evidenced in painting a picture, compos­
ing a symphony, devising new instruments of killing, developing 
a scientific theory, discovering new procedures in human relation­
ships, or creating new formings of one’s own personality as in 
psychotherapy. (Indeed it is my experience in this last field, rather 
than in one of the arts, which has given me special interest in crea­
tivity and its facilitation. Intimate knowledge of the way in which 
the individual remolds himself in the therapeutic relationship, with

350
W h a t A re th f. I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
originality and effective skill, gives one confidence in the creative 
potential of all individuals.)
My definition, then, of the creative process is that it is the emer­
gence in action of a novel relational product, growing out of the 
uniqueness of the individual on the one hand, and the materials, 
events, people, or circumstances of his life on the other.
Let me append some negative footnotes to this definition. It makes 
no distinction between “ good” and “bad” creativity. One man may 
be discovering a way of relieving pain, while another is devising a 
new and more subtle form of torture for political prisoners. Both 
these actions seem to me creative, even though their social value 
is very different. Though I shall comment on these social valuations 
later, I have avoided putting them in my definition because they are 
so fluctuating. Galileo and Copernicus made creative discoveries 
which in their own day were evaluated as blasphemous and wicked, 
and in our day as basic and constructive. We do not want to cloud 
our definition with terms which rest in subjectivity.
Another way of looking at this same issue is to note that to be 
regarded historically as representing creativity, the product must be 
acceptable to some group at some point of time. This fact is not help­
ful to our definition, however, both because of the fluctuating valua­
tions already mentioned, and also because many creative products 
have undoubtedly never been socially noticed, but have disappeared 
without ever having been evaluated. So this concept of group ac­
ceptance is also omitted from our definition.
In addition, it should be pointed out that our definition makes no 
distinction regarding the degree of creativity, since this too is a value 
judgment extremely variable in nature. The action of the child in­
venting a new game with his playmates; Einstein formulating a 
theory of relativity; the housewife devising a new sauce for the 
meat; a young author writing his first novel; all of these are, in 
terms of our definition, creative, and there is no attempt to set them 
in some order of more or less creative.
T h e  M o tiv a tio n fo r C r e a t iv it y
The mainspring of creativity appears to be the same tendency 
which we discover so deeply as the curative force in psychotherapy

Toward a Theory of Creativity
351
— vian's tendency to actualize himself, to become his potentialities. 
By this I mean the directional trend which is evident in all organic 
and human life — the urge to expand, extend, develop, mature — 
the tendency to express and activate all the capacities of the organ­
ism, or the self. This tendency may become deeply buried under 
layer after layer of encrusted psychological defenses; it may be 
hidden behind elaborate fagades which deny its existence; it is my 
belief however, based on my experience, that it exists in every in­
dividual, and awaits only the proper conditions to be released and 
expressed. It is this tendency which is the primary motivation for 
creativity as the organism forms new relationships to the environ­
ment in its endeavor most fully to be itself.
Let us now attempt to deal dircctly with this puzzling issue of the 
social value of a creative act. Presumably few of us are interested 
in facilitating creativity which is socially destructive. W e do not 
wish, knowingly, to lend our efforts to developing individuals whose 
creative genius works itself out in new and better ways of robbing, 
exploiting, torturing, killing, other individuals; or developing forms 
of political organization or art forms which lead humanity into paths 
of physical or psychological self-destruction. Yet how is it possible 
to make the necessary discriminations such that we may encourage 
a constructive creativity and not a destructive?
The distinction cannot be made by examining the product. The 
very essence of the creative is its novelty, and hence we have no 
standard by which to judge it. Indeed history points up the fact 
that the more original the product, and the more far-reaching its 
implications, the more likely it is to be judged by contemporaries 
as evil. The genuinely significant creation, whether an idea, or a 
work of art, or a scientific discovery, is most likely to be seen at 
first as erroneous, bad, or foolish. Later it may be seen as obvious, 
something self-evident to all. Only still later does it receive its final 
evaluation as a creative contribution. It seems clear that no con­
temporary mortal can satisfactorily evaluate a creative product at 
the time that it is formed, and this statement is increasingly true the 
greater the novelty of the creation.
N or is it of any help to examine the purposes of the individual 
participating in the creative process. Many, perhaps most, of the

352
W h a t A re t h e  I m p l ic a t io n s for L iv in g?
creations and discoveries which have proved to have great social 
value, have been motivated by purposes having more to do with 
personal interest than with social value, while on the other hand 
history records a somewhat sorry outcome for many of those crea­
tions (various Utopias, Prohibition, etc.) which had as their avowed 
purpose the achievement of the social good. No, we must face the 
fact that the individual creates primarily because it is satisfying to 
him, because this behavior is felt to be self-actualizing, and we get 
nowhere by trying to differentiate “good” and “ bad” purposes in 
the creative process.
Must we then give over any attempt to discriminate between 
creativity which is potentially constructive, and that which is po­
tentially destructive? I do not believe this pessimistic conclusion is 
justified. It is here that recent clinical findings from the field of 
psychotherapy give us hope. It has been found that when the in­
dividual is “open” to all of his experience (a phrase which will be 
defined more fully), then his behavior will be creative, and his 
creativity may be trusted to be essentially constructive.
The differentiation may be put very briefly as follows. T o  the 
extent that the individual is denying to awareness (or repressing, if 
you prefer that term) large areas of his experience, then his creative 
formings may be pathological, or socially evil, or both. T o the de­
gree that the individual is open to all aspects of his experience, and 
has available to his awareness all the varied sensings and perceivings 
which are going on within his organism, then the novel products of 
his interaction with his environment will tend to be constructive 
both for himself and others. T o illustrate, an individual with para­
noid tendencies may creatively develop a most novel theory of the 
relationship benveen himself and his environment, seeing evidence 
for his theory in all sorts of minute clues. His theory has little so­
cial value, perhaps because there is an enormous range of experience 
which this individual cannot permit in his awareness. Socrates, on 
the other hand, while also regarded as “crazy” by his contemporaries, 
developed novel ideas which have proven to be socially constructive. 
V ery possibly this was because he was notably nondefensive and 
open to his experience.
The reasoning behind this will perhaps become more clear in the

Toward a Theory of Creativity
353
remaining sections of this paper. Primarily however it is based upon 
the discovery in psychotherapy, that as the individual becomes more 
open to, more aware of, all aspects of his experience, he is increas­
ingly likely to act in a manner we would term socialized. If he can 
be aware of his hostile impulses, but also of his desire for friendship 
and acceptance; aware of the expectations of his culture, but equally 
aware of his own purposes; aware of his selfish desires, but also aware 
of his tender and sensitive concern for another; then he behaves in 
a fashion which is harmonious, integrated, constructive. The more 
he is open to his experience, the more his behavior makes it evident 
that the nature of the human species tends in the direction of con­
structively social living.
T h e In n e r  C o n d itio n s o f C o n s t r u c t iv e C r e a t iv it y
What are the conditions within the individual which are most 
closely associated with a potentially constructive creative act? I see 
these as possibilities.
A. 
Openness to experience: Extensionality. This is the opposite of 
psychological defensiveness, when to protect the organization of the 
self, certain experiences are prevented from coming into awareness 
except in distorted fashion. In a person who is open to experience 
each stimulus is freely relayed through the nervous system, without 
being distorted by any process of defensiveness. Whether the stimu­
lus originates in the environment, in the impact of form, color, or 
sound on the sensory nerves, or whether it originates in the viscera, 
or as a memory trace in the central nervous system, it is available to 
awareness. This means that instead of perceiving in predetermined 
categories (“trees are green,” “college education is good,” “modem 
art is silly” ) the individual is aware of this existential moment as it 
is, thus being alive to many experiences which fall outside the usual 
categories (this tree is lavender; this college education is damaging; 
this modern sculpture has a powerful effect on me).
This last suggests another way of describing openness to experi­
ence. It means lack of rigidity and permeability of boundaries in 
concepts, beliefs, perceptions, and hypotheses. It means a tolerance 
for ambiguity where ambiguity exists. It means the ability to re­
ceive much conflicting information without forcing closure upon

354
W h a t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s fo r L iv in g?
the situation. It means what the general semanticist calls the “exten- 
sional orientation.”
This complete openness of awareness to what exists at this moment 
is, I believe, an important condition of constructive creativity. In 
an equally intense but more narrowly limited fashion it is no doubt 
present in all creativity. The deeply maladjusted artist who cannot 
recognize or be aware of the sources of unhappiness in himself, may 
nevertheless be sharply and sensitively aware of form and color in 
his experience. The tyrant (whether on a petty or grand scale) who 
cannot face the weaknesses in himself may nevertheless be com­
pletely alive to and aware of the chinks in the psychological armor 
of those with whom he deals. Because there is the openness to one 
phase of experience, creativity is possible; because the openness is 
only to one phase of experience, the product of this creativity may 
be potentially destructive of social values. The more the individual 
has available to himself a sensitive awareness of all phases of his ex­
perience, the more sure we can be that his creativity will be per­
sonally and socially constructive.
B. An internal locus of evaluation. Perhaps the most fundamental 
condition of creativity is that the source or locus of evaluative judg­
ment is internal. The value of his product is, for the creative person, 
established not by the praise or criticism of others, but by himself. 
Have I created something satisfying to me? Does it express a part 
of me — my feeling or my thought, my pain or my ecstasy? These 
are the only questions which really matter to the creative person, 
or to any person when he is being creative.
This does not mean that he is oblivious to, or unwilling to be aware 
of, the judgments of others. It is simply that the basis of evaluation 
lies within himself, in his own organismic reaction to and appraisal
of his product. If to the person it has the “ feel” of being “ me in
action,” of being an actualization of potentialities in himself which 
heretofore have not existed and are now emerging into existence, 
then it is satisfying and creative, and no outside evaluation can
change that fundamental fact.
C. The ability to toy with elements and concepts. Though this 
is probably less important than A or B, it seems to be a condition of 
creativity. Associated with the openness and lack of rigidity de­

Toward a Theory of Creativity
355
scribed under A is the ability to play spontaneously with ideas, 
colors, shapes, relationships — to juggle elements into impossible 
juxtapositions, to shape wild hypotheses, to make the given problem­
atic, to express the ridiculous, to translate from one form to another, 
to transform into improbable equivalents. It is from this spontaneous 
toying and exploration that there arises the hunch, the creative see­
ing of life in a new and significant way. It is as though out of the 
wasteful spawning of thousands of possibilities there emerges one 
or two evolutionary forms with the qualities which give them a 
more permanent value.
T h e C re a tiv e A c t a nd It s C o n c o m it a n t s
When these three conditions obtain, constructive creativity will 
occur. But we cannot expcct an accurate description of the creative 
act, for by its very nature it is indescribable. This is the unknown 
which we must recognize as unknowable until it occurs. This is the 
improbable that becomes probable. Only in a very general way can 
we say that a creative act is the natural behavior of an organism 
which has a tendency to arise when that organism is open to all of 
its inner and outer experiencing, and when it is free to try out in 
flexible fashion all manner of relationships. Out of this multitude 
of half-formed possibilities the organism, like a great computing 
machine, selects this one which most effectively meets an inner 
need, or that one which forms a more effective relationship with 
the environment, or this other one which discovers a more simple 
and satisfying order in which life may be perceivcd.
There is one quality of the creative act which may, however, 
be described. In almost all the products of creation we note a selec­
tivity, or emphasis, an evidence of discipline, an attempt to bring 
out the essence. The artist paints surfaces or textures in simplified 
form, ignoring the minute variations which exist in reality. The 
scientist formulates a basic law of relationships, brushing aside all 
the particular events or circumstances which might conccal its naked 
beauty. The writer selects those words and phrases which give unity 
to his expression. W e may say that this is the influence of the 
specific person, of the “ I.” Reality exists in a multiplicity of confus­
ing facts, but “ I” bring a structure to my relationship to reality; I

356
W h a t A r e t h e I m p l ic a t io n s for L ivin g?
have “my” way of perceiving reality, and it is this (unconsciously?) 
disciplined personal selectivity or abstraction which gives to creative 
products their esthetic quality.
Though this is as far as we can go in describing any aspect of the 
creative act, there are certain of its concomitants in the individual 
which may be mentioned. The first is what we may call the Eureka 
feeling — “This is it!" “ I have discovered!” “This is what I wanted 
to express!”
Another concomitant is the anxiety of separateness. I do not be­
lieve that many significantly creative products are formed without 
the feeling, “I am alone. N o one has ever done just this before. I 
have ventured into territory where no one has been. Perhaps I am 
foolish, or wrong, or lost, or abnormal.”
Still another experience which usually accompanies creativity is 
the desire to communicate. It is doubtful whether a human being 
can create, without wishing to share his crcation. It is the only way 
he can assuage the anxiety of separateness and assure himself that he 
belongs to the group. He may confide his theories only to his private 
diary. He may put his discoveries in some cryptic code. He may 
conceal his poems in a locked drawer. He may put away his paint­
ings in a closet. Yet he desires to communicate with a group which 
will understand him, even if he must imagine such a group. He does 
not create in order to communicate, but once having created he de­
sires to share this new aspect of himself-in-relation-to-his-environ- 
ment with others.

Thus far I have tried to describe the nature of creativity, to indi­
cate that quality of individual experience which increases the likeli­
hood that creativity will be constructive, to set forth the necessary 
conditions for the creative act and to state some of its concomitants. 
But if we are to make progress in meeting the social need which was 
presented initially, we must know whether constructive creativity 
can be fostered, and if so, how.
From the very nature of the inner conditions of creativity it is 
clear that they cannot be forced, but must be permitted to emerge. 
The farmer cannot make the germ develop and sprout from the

Toward a Theory of Creativity
357
seed; he can only supply the nurturing conditions which will permit 
the seed to develop its own potentialities. So it is with creativity. 
How can we establish the external conditions which will foster and 
nourish the internal conditions described above? M y experience in 
psychotherapy leads me to believe that by setting up conditions of 
psychological safety and freedom, we maximize the likelihood of 
an emergence of constructive creativity. Let me spell out these con­
ditions in some detail, labelling them as X and Y.
X. Psychological safety. This may be established by three associ­
ated processes.
1. Accepting the individual as of unconditional worth. When­
ever a teacher, parent, therapist, or other person with a facilitating 
function feels basically that this individual is of worth in his own 
right and in his own unfolding, no matter what his present condition 
or behavior, he is fostering creativity. This attitude can probably be 
genuine only when the teacher, parent, etc., senses the potentialities 
of the individual and thus is able to have an unconditional faith in 
him, no matter what his present state.
The effect on the individual as he apprehends this attitude, is to 
sense a climate of safety. He gradually learns that he can be what­
ever he is, without sham or fagade, since he seems to be regarded as 
of worth no matter what he does. Hence he has less need of rigidity, 
can discover what it means to be himself, can try to actualize him­
self in new and spontaneous ways. He is, in other words, moving 
toward creativity.
2. Providing a climate in which external evaluation is absent. 
When we cease to form judgments of the other individual from our 
own locus of evaluation, we are fostering creativity. For the in­
dividual to find himself in an atmosphere where he is not being 
evaluated, not being measured by some external standard, is enor­
mously freeing. Evaluation is always a threat, always creates a need 
for defensiveness, always means that some portion of experience 
must be denied to awareness. If this product is evaluated as good by 
external standards, then I must not admit my own dislike of it. If 
what I am doing is bad by external standards, then I must not be 
aware of the fact that it seems to be me, to be part of myself. But 
if judgments based on external standards are not being made then

358
W h a t  A r e  t h e  I m p lic a t io n s  f o r  L iv in g5
I can be more open to my experience, can recognize my own likings 
and dislikings, the nature of the materials and of my reaction to 
them, more sharply and more sensitively. I can begin to recognize 
the locus of evaluation within myself. Hence I am moving toward 
creativity.
T o allay some possible doubts and fears in the reader, it should 
be pointed out that to cease evaluating another is not to cease having 
reactions. It may, as a matter of fact, free one to react. “I don’t 
like your idea” (or painting, or invention, or writing), is not an 
evaluation, but a reaction. It is subtly but sharply different from a 
judgment which says, “W hat you are doing is bad (or good), and 
this quality is assigned to you from some external source.” The first 
statement permits the individual to maintain his own locus of evalua­
tion. It holds the possibility that I am unable to appreciate some­
thing which is actually very good. The second statement, whether 
it praises or condemns, tends to put the person at the mercy of out­
side forces. He is being told that he cannot simply ask himself 
whether this product is a valid expression of himself; he must be 
concerned with wrhat others think. He is being led away from 
creativity.
3. 
Understanding empathically. 
It is this which provides the 
ultimate in psychological safety, when added to the other two. If 
I say that I “accept” you, but know nothing of you, this is a shallow 
acceptance indeed, and you realize that it may change if I actually 
come to know you. But if I understand you empathically, see you 
and what you are feeling and doing from your point of view, enter 
your private world and see it as it appears to you — and still accept 
you — then this is safety indeed. In this climate you can permit your 
real self to emerge, and to express itself in varied and novel formings 
as it relates to the world. This is a basic fostering of creativity.
Y. Psychological freedom. When a teacher, parent, therapist, or 
other facilitating person permits the individual a complete freedom 
of symbolic expression, creativity is fostered. This permissiveness 
gives the individual complete freedom to think, to feel, to be, what­
ever is most inward within himself. It fosters the openness, and the 
playful and spontaneous juggling of percepts, concepts, and mean­
ings, which is a part of creativity.

Toward a Theory of Creativity
359
Note that it is complete freedom of symbolic expression which is 
described. T o express in behavior all feelings, impulses, and form­
ings may not in all instances be freeing. Behavior may in some 
instances be limited by society, and this is as it should be. But sym­
bolic expression need not be limited. Thus to destroy a hated object 
(whether one’s mother or a rococo building) by destroying a sym­
bol of it, is freeing. T o attack it in reality may create guilt and 
narrow the psychological freedom which is experienced. (I feel 
unsure of this paragraph, but it is the best formulation I can give at 
the moment which seems to square with my experience.)
The permissiveness which is being described is not softness or 
indulgence or encouragement. It is permission to be free, which also 
means that one is responsible. The individual is as free to be afraid 
of a new venture as to be eager for it; free to bear the consequences 
of his mistakes as well as of his achievements. It is this type of free­
dom responsibly to be oneself which fosters the development of a 
secure locus of evaluation within oneself, and hence tends to bring 
about the inner conditions of constructive creativity.
C o n c l u sio n
I have endeavored to present an orderly way of thinking about 
the creative process, in order that some of these ideas might be put 
to a rigorous and objective test. M y justification for formulating 
this theory, and my reason for hoping that such research may be 
carried out is that the present development of the physical scicnces 
is making an imperative demand upon us, as individuals and as a cul­
ture, for creative behavior in adapting ourselves to our new world 
if we are to survive.

The Behavioral Sciences 
and the Person
I feel a deep concern 
that the developing behavioral sciences 
may be used to control the individual and to rob him 
of his personhood. 1 believe, however, that these 
sciences might be used to enhance the person.

The Growing Power of 
the Behavioral Sciences
L
ate in 1955 Professor B. F. Skinner of Harvard invited me to 
j  participate in a friendly debate 'with him at the convention of 
the American Psychological Association in the fall of 1956. He knew 
that we held very divergent views as to the use of scientific knowl­
edge in molding or controlling human behavior, and suggested that 
a debate would serve a useful purpose by clarifying the issue. His 
own basic point of view he had expressed by deploring the unwill­
ingness of psychologists to use their power. “ At the moment psy­
chologists are curiously diffident in assuming control where it is 
available or in developing it where it is not. In most clinics the 
emphasis is still upon psychometry, and this is in part due to an 
unwillingness to assume the responsibility of control. . . .  In some 
curious way we feel compelled to leave the active control of human 
behavior to those who grasp it for selfish purposes 
1 was in agreement with him that such a discussion would serve a 
valuable purpose in stirring interest in an important issue. We held 
the debate in September 1956. It attracted a large and attentive 
audience, and, as is the way in debates, most of the ?nembers doubt­
less left feeling confirmed in the views they held when they came

in. The text of the debate was published in Scicnce, Nov. 30, 1956, 
124, pp. 1051-1066.
As 1 1milled over this experience afterward, my only dissatisfaction 
lay in the fact that it was a debate. While both Skinner and 1 had 
endeavored to avoid argument for argument's sake, the tone was 
nevertheless of an either-or variety. I felt that the question was far 
too important to be thought of as an argument between two persons, 
or a simple black versus white issue. So during the following year 
I wrote out at greater length, and with, I believe, less argumentative­
ness, my own perception of the elements in this problem which one 
day will be seen as a profoundly momentous decision for society. 
The exposition seemed to fall naturally into two parts, and these 
constitute the two chapters which follow.
I had no particular plan in mind for the use of these documents 
when 1 wrote them. 1 have however used them as the basis for lec­
tures to the course on “ Contemporary Trends” at the University of 
Wisconsin, and this past year / used them as the basis for a seminar 
presentation to faculty and students at the California Institute of 
T  
echnology.

h e sc ie n c e s w h ic h  d ea l w it h  beh a v io r are in an infant state. 
This eluster of scicntific disciplines is usually thought of as in­
cluding psychology, psychiatry, sociology, social psychology, an­
thropology, and biology, though sometimes the other social sciences 
such as economics and political scicnce arc included, and mathematics 
and statistics are very much involved as instrumental disciplines. 
Though they are all at work trying to understand the behavior of 
man and animals, and though research in these fields is growing by 
leaps and bounds, it is still an area in which there is undoubtedly 
more confusion than solid knowledge. Thoughtful workers in these 
fields tend to stress the enormity of our scicntific ignorance regard­
ing behavior, and the paucity of general laws which have been dis­
covered. They tend to compare the state of this field of scientific

endeavor with that of physics, and seeing the relative precision of 
measurement, accuracy of prediction, and elegance and simplicity of 
the discovered lawfulness in this latter field, are vividly aware of 
the newness, the infancy, the immaturity, of the behavioral science 
field.
Without in any way denying the truthfulness of this picture, I 
believe it is sometimes stressed to the point where the general public 
may fail to recognize the other side of the coin. Behavioral science, 
even though in its infancy, has made mighty strides toward becoming 
an “ if —  then” science. By this I mean that it has made striking 
progress in discerning and discovering lawful relationships such that 
if certain conditions exist, then certain behaviors will predictably 
follow. I believe that too few people are aware of the extent, the 
breadth, and the depth of the advances which have been made in 
rccent decades in the behavioral sciences. Still fewer seem to be 
aware of the profound social, educational, political, economic, 
ethical, and philosophical problems posed by these advances.
I would like in this and the subsequent lecture to accomplish 
several purposes. First, I would like to sketch, in an impressionistic 
manner, a picture of the growing ability of the behavioral sciences 
to understand, predict, and control behavior. Then I should like to 
point out the serious questions and problems which such achieve­
ments pose for us as individuals and as a society. Then I should like 
to suggest a tentative resolution of these problems which has mean­
ing for me.
T h e  “ K n o w - H o w ”  o k t h e  B e h a v io r a l  S c i e n c e s
Let us try to obtain some impression of the significance of knowl­
edge in the behavioral sciences by dipping in here and there to take 
a look at specific studies and their meanings. I have endeavored to 
choose illustrations which would indicate something of the range of 
the work being done. I am limited by the scope of my own knowl­
edge, and make no claim that these illustrations represent a truly 
random sampling of the behavioral sciences. I am sure thut the fact 
that I am a psychologist means that I tend to draw a disproportionate

366
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s and th e P er so n
share of examples from that field. I have also tended to select illus­
trations which emphasize the prediction and potential control of be­
havior, rather than those whose central significance is simply to 
increase our understanding of behavior. I am quite aware that in the 
long run these latter studies may lend themselves even more deeply 
to prediction and control, but their relevance to such problems is not 
so immediately evident.
In giving these samplings of our scientific knowledge, I shall state 
them in simple terms, without the various qualifying elements which 
are important for rigorous accuracy. Each general statement I shall 
make is supported by reasonably adequate research, though like all 
scientific findings each statement is an expression of a given de­
gree of probability, not of some absolute truth. Furthermore each 
statement is open to modification and correction or even refutation 
through more exact or more imaginative studies in the future.
P re d ic tio n o f B eh a v iors 
W ith these selective factors and qualifications in mind let us first 
look at some of the achievements in the behavioral sciences in which 
the element of prediction is prominent. The pattern of each of these 
can be generalized as follows: “ If an individual possesses measurable 
characteristics a, b, and c then we can predict that there is a high 
probability that he will exhibit behaviors x, y, and 2.”
Thus, we know how to predict, with considerable accuracy, which 
individuals will be successful college students, successful industrial 
executives, successful insurance salesmen, and the like. I will not at­
tempt to document this statement, simply because the documenta­
tion would be so extensive. The whole field of aptitude testing, of 
vocational testing, of personnel selection is involved. Although the 
specialists in these fields are rightly concerned with the degree of 
inaccuracy in their predictions, the fact remains that here is a wide 
area in which the work of the behavioral sciences is accepted by 
multitudes of hardheaded industries, universities and other organiza­
tions. W e have come to accept the fact that out of an unknown 
group the behavioral scientist can select (with a certain margin of 
error) those persons who will be successful typists, practice teachers, 
filing clerks, or physicists.

Growing Power of the Behavioral Sciences

This field is continually expanding. Efforts are being made to 
determine the characteristics of the creative chemist, for example, 
as over against the merely successful chemist, and, though without 
outstanding success, efforts have been and are being made to deter­
mine the characteristics which will identify the potentially success­
ful psychiatrist and clinical psychologist. Science is moving steadily 
forward in its ability to say whether or not you possess the measur­
able characteristics which are associated with a certain type of occu­
pational activity.
We know how to predict success in schools for military officer 
candidates, and in combat performance. T o select one study in this 
field, Williams and Leavitt (31) found that they could make satis­
factory predictions regarding a Marine’s probable success in OCS 
and in later combat performance by obtaining ratings from his 
“ buddies.” They also found that in this instance the man’s fellow 
soldiers were better psychological instruments than were the ob­
jective tests they used. There is illustrated here not only the use of 
certain measures to predict behavior, but a willingness to use those 
measures, whether conventional or unconventional, which are dem­
onstrated to have predictive power.
We can predict how radical or conservative a potential business 
executive will be. W hyte (30), in his recent book cites this as one 
of many examples of tests that are in regular use in industrial cor­
porations. Thus in a group of young executives up for promotion, 
top management can select those who will exhibit (within a margin 
of error) whatever degree of conservatism or radicalism is calculated 
to be for the best welfare of the company. They can also base their 
selection on knowledge of the degree to which each man has a 
latent hostility to society, or latent homosexuality, or psychotic 
tendencies. Tests giving (or purporting to give) such measures are 
in use by many corporations both for screening purposes in selection 
of new management personnel, and also for purposes of evaluation 
of men already in management positions, in order to choose those 
who will be given greater responsibilities.
We know how to predict which members of an organization will 
be troublemakers and!or delinquent. A promising young psycholo­
gist (10) has devised a short, simple pencil and paper test which

368
T h e B e h a v io ra l S c ie n c e s and t h e  P erso n
has shown a high degree of accuracy in predicting which of the 
employees hired by a department store will be unreliable, dishonest, 
or otherwise difficult. He states that it is quite possible to identify, 
with considerable precision, the potential troublemakers in any or­
ganized group. This ability to identify those who will make trouble 
is, so far as the technical issues are concerned, simply an extension 
of the knowledge we have of prediction in other fields. From the 
scicntific point of view it is no different from predicting who will 
be a good typesetter.
We know that a competent clerical worker, using a combination 
of test scores and actuarial tables, can give a better predictive picture 
of a person’s personality and behavior, than can an experienced clini­
cian. Paul Meehl (18) has shown that we are sufficiently advanced 
in our development of personality tests, and in information accumu­
lated through these tests, that intuitive skill and broad knowledge, 
experience, and training, are quite unnecessary in producing accurate 
personality descriptions. He has shown that in many situations in 
which personality diagnoses are being made — mental hygiene 
clinics, veteran’s hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and the like, it is 
wasteful to use well-trained professional personnel to make person­
ality diagnoses through the giving of tests, interviewing the person 
and the like. He has shown that a clerk can do it better, with only 
a minimum and impersonal contact with the patient. First a number 
of tests would be administered and scored. Then the profile of 
scores would be looked up in actuarial tables prepared on the basis 
of hundreds of cases, and an accurate and predictive description of 
personality would emerge, the clerk simply copying down the com­
bination of characteristics which had been found to be statistically 
correlated with this configuration of scores.
Aleehl is here simply carrying forward to the next logical step the 
current development of psychological instruments for the measure­
ment, appraisal and evaluation of human characteristics, and the pre­
diction of certain behavior patterns on the basis of those measure­
ments. Indeed, there is no reason why Aleehl’s clerk could not also 
be eliminated. W ith proper coded instructions there is no reason 
why an electronic computer could not score the tests, analyze the 
profiles and come up with an even more accurate picture of the 
person and his predicted behavior than a human clerk.

Growing Power of the Behavioral Sciences
369
We can select those persons r
who are easily persuaded, who will 
conform to group pressures, or those who will not yield. Tw o 
separate but compatible studies (15, 16) show that individuals who 
exhibit certain dependency themes in their responses to the pictures 
of the Thematic Apperception Test, or who, on another test, show 
evidence of feelings of social inadequacy, inhibition of aggression, 
and depressive tendencies, will be easily persuaded, or will yield to 
group pressures. These small studies are by no means definitive, but 
there is every reason to suppose that their basic hypothesis is correct 
and that these or other more refined measures will accurately predict 
which members of a group will be easily persuaded, and which will 
be unyielding even to fairly strong group pressures.
We can predict, from the way individuals perceive the movement 
of a spot of light in a dark room, whether they tend to he prejudiced 
or unprejudiced. There has been much study of ethnocentrism, the 
tendency toward a pervasive and rigid distinction between ingroups 
and outgroups, with hostility toward outgroups, and a submissive 
attitude toward, and belief in the rightness of, ingroups. One of the 
theories which has developed is that the more ethnocentric person 
is unable to tolerate ambiguity or uncertainty in a situation. Operat­
ing on this theory Block and Block (5) had subjects report on the 
degree of movement they perceived in a dim spot of light in a com­
pletely dark room. (Actually no movement occurs, but almost all 
individuals perceive movement in this situation.) They also gave 
these same subjects a test of ethnocentrism. It was found, as pre­
dicted, that those who, in successive trials, quickly established a norm 
for the amount of movement they perceived, tended to be more 
ethnocentric than those whose estimates of movement continued to 
show variety.
This study was repeated, with slight variation, in Australia (28), 
and the findings were confirmed and enlarged, ft was found that 
the more ethnocentric individuals were less able to tolerate am­
biguity, and saw less movement than the unprejudiced. They also 
were more dependent on others and when making their estimates 
in the company of another person, tended to conform to the judg­
ment of that person.
Hence it is not too much to say that by studying the way the 
individual perceives the movement of a dim light in a dark room, we

370
T h e B eh av io ra l S c ie n c e s an d th e P er so n
can tell a good deal about the degree to which he is a rigid, preju­
diced, ethnocentric person.
This hodgepodge of illustrations of the ability of the behavioral 
scicnces to predict behavior, and hence to select individuals who will 
exhibit certain behaviors, may be seen simply as the burgeoning ap­
plications of a growing field of science. But what these illustrations 
suggest can also cause a cold chill of apprehension. The thoughtful 
person cannot help but recognize that these developments I have 
described are but the beginning. He cannot fail to see that if more 
highly developed tools were in the hands of an individual or group, 
together with the power to use them, the social and philosophical 
implications are awesome. He can begin to see why a scientist like 
von Bertalanffy warns, “Besides the menace of physical technology, 
the dangers of psychological technology are often overlooked” (3).

But before we dwell on this social problem, let us move on to 
another area of the behavioral sciences, and again take a sampling 
of illustrative studies. This time let us look at some of the research 
which shows potentiality for control of groups. In this realm we 
are interested in investigations whose findings are of this pattern: 
“7f conditions a, b, and c exist or are established in a group, then 
there is a high probability that these conditions will be followed by 
behaviors x, y, and z.”
We know how to provide conditions in a work group, whether 
in industry or in education, which will be followed by increased 
productivity, originality, and morale. Studies by Coch and French 
(7), by Nagle (19), and by Katz, Macoby, and Morse (17) show in 
general that when workers in industry participate in planning and in 
decisions, when supervisors are sensitive to worker attitudes, and 
when supervision is not suspicious or authoritarian, production and 
morale increase. Conversely we know how to provide the conditions 
which lead to low productivity and low morale, since the reverse 
conditions produce a reverse effect.
We know how to establish, i?i any group, the conditions of lead­
ership which will be followed by personality development in the 
members of the group, as well as by increased productivity and origi-

Ci rom ng Power of the Behavioral Sciences

ujlity, and improved gi oup spirit. In groups as diverse as a brief uni­
versity workshop and an industrial plant making castings, Gordon 
(9) and Richard (22) have shown that where the leader or leaders 
hold attitudes customarily thought of as therapeutic, the results are 
good. In other words if the leader is acceptant, both of the feelings 
of group members and of his own feelings; if he is understanding of 
others in a sensitively empathic way; if he permits and encourages 
free discussion; if he places responsibility with the group; then 
there is evidence of personality growth in the members of the group, 
and the group functions more effectively, with greater creativity and 
better spirit.
We know how to establish conditions which will result in in­
creased psychological rigidity in members of a group. Beier (2), 
in a careful study, took two matched groups of students and meas­
ured several aspects of their abilities, particularly abstract reasoning. 
Each of the students in one group was then given an analysis of his 
personality based upon the Rorschach test. Following this both 
groups were re-tested as to their abilities. The group which had 
been given an evaluation of their personalities showed a decrease in 
flexibility, and a significant decrease in ability to carry on abstract 
reasoning. They became more rigid, anxious, and disorganized in 
their thinking, in contrast to the control group.
It w'ould be tempting to note that this evaluation — experienced 
by the group as somewhat threatening — seems very similar to 
many evaluations made in our schools and universities under the 
guise of education. All we are concerned with at the moment is 
that we do know how to establish the conditions which make for 
less effective functioning on complex intellectual tasks.
We know a great deal about how to establish conditions which 
will influence consumer responses and/or public opinion. I think 
this need not be documented with research studies. I refer you to 
the advertisements in any magazine, to the beguilements of T V  pro­
grams and their Trendex ratings, to the firms of public relations ex­
perts, and to the upward trend of sales by any corporation which 
puts on a well-planned series of ads.
We know how to influence the buying behavior of individuals by 
setting up conditions which provide satisfaction for needs of which

372
T h e B e h a v io r a l S c ie n c e s  a n d  t h e  P e rso n
they aic unconscious, but 'which we have been able to determine. 
It has been shown that some women who do not buy instant coffee 
because of “a dislike for its flavor” actually dislike it at a subcon­
scious level because it is associated with being a poor housekeeper
— with laziness and spendthrift qualities (11). This type of study, 
based on the use of projective techniques and “depth” interviews, 
has led to sales campaigns built upon appeals to the unconscious 
motives of the individual — his unknown sexual, aggressive, or de­
pendent desires, or as in this instance, the desire for approval.
These illustrative studies indicate something of our potential 
ability to influence or control the behavior of groups. If we have 
the power or authority to establish the necessary conditions, the 
predicted behaviors will follow. There is no doubt that both the 
studies and the methods are, at the present time crude, but more 
refined ones are sure to develop.
C o n d itio n s W h ic h P ro d u ce S p e c if ie d  E f f e c t s in  I n d iv id u a ls
Perhaps even more impressive than our knowledge of groups is 
the knowledge which is accumulating in the behavioral sciences as 
to the conditions which will be followed by specified types of be­
havior in the individual. It is the possibility of scientific prediction 
and control of individual behavior which comes closest to the inter­
ests of each one of us. Again let us look at scattered bits of this type 
of knowledge.
We know how to set 7tp the conditions under which many in­
dividuals will report as true, judgments which are contrary to the 
evidence of their senses. They will, for example report that Figure 
A covers a larger area than Figure B, when the evidence of their 
senses plainly indicates that the reverse is true. Experiments bv Asch 
(1) later refined and improved by Crutchfield (8) show that w^hcn 
a person is led to believe that everyone else in the group sees A as 
larger than B, then he has a strong tendency to go along with this 
judgment, and in many instances does so with a real belief in his 
false report.
N ot only can we predict that a certain prccentage of individuals 
will thus yield, and disbelieve their own senses, but Crutchfield lias 
determined the personality attributes of those who will do so, and

by selection procedures would be able to choose a group who would 
almost uniformly give in to these pressures for conformity.
We know how to change the opinions of tin individual in a selected 
direction, without his ever becoming aware of the stimuli which 
changed his opinion. A static, expressionless portrait of a man was 
flashed on a screen by Smith, Spence and Klein (27). They re­
quested their subjects to note how the expression of the picture 
changed. Then they intermittently flashed the word “angry” on 
the screen, at exposures so brief that the subjects were consciously 
completely unaware of having seen the word. They tended, how­
ever, to sec the face as becoming more angry. When the word 
“ happy” was flashed on the screen in similar fashion, the viewers 
tended to see the face as becoming more happy. Thus they were 
clearly influenced by stimuli which registered at a subliminal level, 
stimuli of which the individual was not, and could not be, aware.
We know how to influence psychological moodsy
 attitudes, and 
behaviors, through drugs. For this illustration we step over into 
the rapidly developing borderline area between chemistry and 
psychology. From drugs to keep awake while driving or studying, 
to so-called “ truth serum” which reduces the psychological defenses 
of the individual, to the chemotherapy now practiced in psychiatric 
wards, the range and complexity of the growing knowledge in this 
field is striking. Increasingly there are efforts to find drugs with 
more specific effects — a drug which will energize the depressive 
individual, another to calm the excited, and the like. Drugs have 
reportedly been given to soldiers before a battle to eliminate fear. 
Trade names for the tranquili/.ing drugs such as Miltown have al­
ready crept into our language, even into our cartoons. 
While 
much is still unknown in this field, Dr. Skinner of Harvard states 
that, “ In the not-too-distant future, the motivational and emotional 
conditions of normal life will probably be maintained in any desired 
state through the use of drugs” (26). While this seems to be a 
somewhat exaggerated view, his prediction could be partially justi­
fied.
We know how to provide psychological conditions which will 
produce vivid hallucinations and other abnormal reactions in the 
thoroughly normal individual in the waking state. T his knowledge

374
T h e  B e h a v io r a l S c ie n c e s a n d  t h e  Plkson
came about as the unexpected by-product of research at AIcGill 
University (4). It was discovered that if all channels of sensory 
stimulation are cut off or muffled, abnormal reactions follow. If 
healthy subjects lie motionless, to reduce kinaesthctic stimuli, with 
eyes shielded by translucent goggles which do not permit percep­
tion, with hearing largely stifled by foam rubber pillows as well as 
by being in a quiet cubicle, and with tactile sensations reduccd by 
cuffs over the hands, then hallucinations and bizarre ideation bearing 
some resemblance to that of the psychotic occur within forty-eight 
hours in most subjects. W hat the results would be if the sensory 
stifling were continued longer is not known because the experience 
seemed so potentially dangerous that the investigators were reluctant 
to continue it.
We know how to use a person's own words to open tip whole 
troubled areas in his experience. Cameron (6) and his associates 
have taken from recorded therapeutic interviews with a patient, brief 
statements by the patient which seem significantly related to the 
underlying dynamics of the case. Such a brief statement is then put 
on a continuous tape so that it can be played over and over. When 
the patient hears his own significant words repeated again and again, 
the effect is very potent. By the time it has been repeated twenty or 
thirty times the patient often begs to have it stopped. It seems clear 
that it penetrates the individual’s defenses, and opens up the whole 
psychic area related to the statement. For example, a woman who 
feels very inadequate and is having marital difficulties, talked about 
her mother in one interview, saying of her, among other things, 
“That’s what I can’t understand — that one could strike at a little 
child.” This recorded sentence was played over and over to her. 
It made her very uneasy and frightened. It also opened up to her 
all her feelings about her mother. It helped her to see that “not 
being able to trust my mother not to hurt me has made me mistrust­
ful of everybody.” This is a very simple example of the potency of 
the method, which can not only be helpful but which can be dan­
gerously disorganizing if it penetrates the defenses too deeply or 
too rapidly.
We know the attitudes which, if provided by a counselor or a 
therapist, will be predictably followed by certain constructive per­

sonality and behavior changes in the client. Studies we have com­
pleted in recent years in the field of psychotherapy (23, 24, 25, 29) 
justify this statement. The findings from these studies may be very 
briefly summarized in the following way.
If the therapist provides a relationship in which he is (a) genuine, 
internally consistent; (b) acceptant, prizing the client as a person 
of worth; (c) empathically understanding of the client’s private 
world of feelings and attitudes; then certain changes occur in the 
client. Some of these changes are; the client becomes (a) more real­
istic in his self-perceptions; (b) more confident and self-directing; 
(c) more positively valued by himself; (d) less likely to repress ele­
ments of his experience; (c) more mature, socialized and adaptive 
in his behavior; (f) less upset by stress and quicker to recover from 
it; (g) more like the healthy, integrated, well-functioning person 
in his personality structure. These changes do not occur in a control 
group, and appear to be definitely associated with the client’s being 
in a therapeutic relationship.
We know how to disintegrate a marts personality structure, dis­
solving his self-confidence, destroying the concept he has of himself, 
and making him dependent on another. A very careful study by 
Hinkle and W olff (13) of methods of Communist interrogation of 
prisoners, particularly in Communist China, has given us a reason­
ably accurate picture of the process popularly known as “ brainwash­
ing.” Their study has shown that no magical nor essentially new 
methods have been used, but mostly a combination of practices de­
veloped by rule of thumb. W hat is involved is largely a somewhat 
horrifying reversal of the conditions of psychotherapy briefly noted 
above. If the individual under suspicion is rejected and isolated for 
a long time, then his need for a human relationship is greatly intensi­
fied. The interrogator exploits this by building a relationship in 
which he shows mostly non-acceptance, and does all he can to arouse 
guilt, conflict and anxiety. He is acceptant toward the prisoner only 
when the prisoner “cooperates” by being willing to view events 
through the interrogator’s eyes. He is completely rejecting of the 
prisoner’s internal frame of reference, or personal perception of 
events. Gradually, out of his need for more acceptance, the prisoner 
comes to accept halftruths as being true, until little by little he has

376
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s and t h e P erso n
given up his own view of himself and of his behavior, and has ac- 
ccpted the viewpoint of his interrogator. He is very much demoral­
ized and disintegrated as a person, and largely the puppet of the in­
terrogator. He is then willing to “ confess” that he is an enemy of the 
state, and has committed all kinds of treasonable acts which either he 
has not done, or which actually had a very different significance.
In a sense it is misleading to describe these methods as a product 
of the behavioral sciences. They were developed by the Russian and 
Chinese police, not by scientists. Yet I include them here since it is 
very clear that these crude methods could be made decidedly more 
effective by means of scientific knowledge which we now possess. 
In short our knowledge of how personality and behavior may be 
changed can be used constructively or destructively, to build or to 
destroy persons.

Perhaps I have already given ample evidence of the significant and 
often frightening power of this young field of science. Yet before 
we turn to the implications of all this, I should like to push the matter 
one step further by mentioning a few small bits of the very large 
amount of knowledge which has accumulated in regard to the be­
havior of animals. Here my own acquaintance is even more limited, 
but I would like to mention three suggestive studies and their find­
ings.
We know how to establish the conditions which will cause young 
ducklings to develop a lasting devotion to, for example, an old shoe. 
Hess (12) has carricd out studies of the phenomenon of “imprint­
ing,” first investigated in Europe. He has shown that in mallard 
ducklings, for example, there are a few crucial hours — from the 
13th to the 17th hour after hatching — when the duckling becomes 
attached to any object to which it may be exposed. The more effort 
it exerts in following this object, the more intense will be the attach­
ment. Normally of course this results in an attachment to the mother 
duck, but the duckling can just as easily form an indelible devotion 
to any goal object — to a decoy duck, to a human being, or, as I 
have mentioned, to an old shoe. Is there any similar tendency in the 
human infant? One cannot help but speculate.

Growing Power of the Behavioral Sciences
377
We know how to eliminate a strong specific fear in a rat by means 
of clectro-convnlsive shock. Hunt and Brady (14) first trained 
thirsty rats to obtain water by pressing a lever. This they did freely 
and frequently while in the experimental box. When this habit was 
well fixed a conditioned fear was established by having a clicker 
sound for a time before a mildly painful electric shock was adminis­
tered. After a time the rats responded with strong fear reactions and 
cessation of all lever pressing whenever the clicker sounded, even 
though the clicking was not followed bv any painful stimulus. This 
conditioned fear reaction was however almost completely eliminated 
by a series of electo-convulsive shocks administered to the animals. 
Following this scries of shock treatments the animals showed no 
fear, and freely pressed the lever, even while the clicker was sound­
ing. The authors interpret their results very cautiously, but the gen­
eral similarity to shock therapy administered to human beings is 
obvious.
We know how to train pigeons so that they can direct an explosive 
missile to a pre-determined target. Skinner’s amusing account (26a) 
of this wartime development is only one of many impressive in­
stances of the possibilities of so-called operant conditioning. He took 
pigeons and “shaped up” their peeking behavior by rewarding them 
whenever they came at all close to pecking in the direction of, or at, 
an object he had preselected. Thus he could take a map of a foreign 
city, and gradually train pigeons to peck only at that portion which 
contained some vital industry — an airplane factory, for instance. 
Or he could train them to peck only at representations of certain 
types of ship at sea. It was then only a technical matter, though to 
be sure a complex one, to turn their pcckings into guidance for a 
missile. Housing two or three pigeons in the simulated nose of a 
missile he was able to show that no matter how it might veer off 
course the pigeons would bring it back “on target” by their pecking.
In response to what I am sure must be your question, I must say 
that, No, it was never used in warfare, because of the unexpectedly 
rapid development of electronic devices. But that it would have 
worked, there seems little question.
Skinner has been able to train pigeons to play ping pong, for 
example, and he and his co-workers have been able to develop many

378
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s and t h e  P erso n
complex behaviors in animals which seem “intelligent” and “pur­
poseful.” The principle is the same in all instances. The animal is 
given positive reinforcement — some small reward — for every be­
havior which is at all in the direction of the purpose selected by the 
investigator. At first perhaps it is only very gross behaviors which 
in a general way are in the desired direction. But more and more 
the behavior is “shaped up” to a refined, exact, specific set of pre­
selected actions. From the vast behavioral repertoire of an organism, 
those behaviors are reinforced with increasing refinement, which 
serve the exact purpose of the investigator.
Experiments with human beings are a little less clearcut, but it has 
been shown that by such operant conditioning (such as a nod of the 
head by the investigator) one can bring about an increase in the 
number of plural nouns, or statements of personal opinion, expressed 
by the subject, without his having any awareness of the reason for 
this change in his behavior. In Skinner’s view much of our behavior 
is the result of such operant conditioning, often unconscious on the 
part of both participants. He would like to make it conscious and 
purposeful, and thus controlling of behavior.
We know how to provide animals with a most satisfying ex­
perience consisting entirely of electrical stimulation. Olds (20) has 
found that he can implant tiny electrodes in the septal area of the 
brain of laboratory rats. When one of these animals presses a bar 
in his cage, it causes a minute current to pass through these elec­
trodes. This appears to be such a rewarding experience that the ani­
mal goes into an orgy of bar pressing, often until he is exhausted. 
Whatever the subjective nature of the experience it seems to be so 
satisfying that the animal prefers it to any other activity. I will not 
speculate as to whether this procedure might be applied to human 
beings, nor what, in this case, its consequences would be.
T h e G e n e r a l P ic t u r e and It s I m p l ic a t io n s
I hope that these numerous specific illustrations will have given 
concrete meaning to the statement that the behavioral sciences are 
making rapid strides in the understanding, prediction, and control of 
behavior. In important ways we know how to select individuals who 
will exhibit certain behaviors; to establish conditions in groups which

Growing Power of the Behavioral Sciences
379
will lead to various predictable group behaviors; to establish condi­
tions which, in an individual, will lead to specified behavioral results; 
and in animals our ability to understand, predict and control goes 
even further, possibly foreshadowing future steps in relation to man.
If your reaction is the same as mine then you will have found that 
this picture I have given has its deeply frightening aspccts. With all 
the immaturity of this young science, and its vast ignorance, even its 
present state of knowledge contains awesome possibilities. Suppose 
some individual or group had both the knowledge available, and the 
power to use that knowledge for some purpose. Individuals could be 
selected who would be leaders and others who would be followers. 
Persons could be developed, enhanced and facilitated, or they could 
be weakened and disintegrated. Troublemakers could be discovered 
and dealt with before they became such. Morale could be improved 
or lowered. Behavior could be influenced by appeals to motives of 
which the individual was unconscious. It could be a nightmare of 
manipulation. Admittedly this is wild fantasy, but it is not an im­
possible fantasy. Perhaps it makes clear the reason why Robert 
Oppenheimer, one of the most gifted of our natural scientists, looks 
out from his own domain of physics, and out of the experiences in 
that field voices a warning. He says that there are some similarities 
between physics and psychology, and one of these similarities “ is the 
extent to which our progress will create profound problems of de­
cision in the public domain. The physicists have been quite noisy 
about their contributions in the last decade. The time may well 
com e— as psychology acquires a sound objective corpus of 
knowledge about human behavior and feeling — when the powers of 
control thus made available will pose far graver problems than any 
the physicists have posed.” (21)
Some of you may feel that I have somehow made the problem 
more serious than it is. You may point out that only a very few of 
the scientific findings I have mentioned have actually been put to 
use in any way that significantly affects society, and that for the 
most part these studies are important to the behavioral scientist but 
have little practical impact on our culture.
I quite agree with this last point. The behavioral scienccs at the 
present time are at somewhat the same stage as the physical sciences

380
T he B e h a v io r a l S c ie n c e s  a n d  t h e  P e rso n
several generations ago. As a rather recent example of what I mean, 
take the argument which occurred around 1900 as to whether a 
heavier-than-air machine could fly. The science of aeronautics was 
not well-developed or precise, so that though there were findings 
which gave an affirmative answer, other studies could be lined up on 
the negative side. Most important of all, the public did not believe 
that this scicnce possessed any validity, or would ever significantly 
affect the culture. They preferred to use their common sense, which 
told them that man could not possibly fly in a contraption which was 
heavier than air.
Contrast the public attitude toward aeronautics at that time with 
the attitude today. W e were told, a few years ago, that science pre­
dicted we would launch a satellite into space, an utterly fantastic 
scheme. But so deeply had the public come to have faith in the nat­
ural sciences that not a voice was raised in disbelief. The only ques­
tion the public asked was, “W hen?”
There is every reason to believe that the same sequence of events 
will occur in connection with the behavioral sciences. First the pub­
lic ignores or views with disbelief; then as it discovers that the find­
ings of a science are more dependable than common sense, it begins 
to use them; the widespread use of the knowledge of a science creates 
a tremendous demand, so that men and money and effort are poured 
into the science; finally the development of the science spirals up­
ward at an ever-increasing rate. It seems highly probable that this 
sequence will be observed in the behavioral sciences. Consequently 
even though the findings of these sciences are not widely used today, 
there is every likelihood that they will be widely used tomorrow.
T h e Q u e st io n s
W e have in the making then a science of enormous potential im­
portance, an instrumentality whose social power will make atomic 
energy seem feeble by comparison. And there is no doubt that the 
questions raised by this development will be questions of vital impor­
tance for this and coming generations. Let us look at a few of these 
questions.
How shall we use the power of this new science?
W hat happens to the individual person in this brave new world?

Growing Power of the Behavioral Sciences
381
Who will hold the power to use this new knowledge?
Toward what end or purpose or value will this new type of 
knowledge be used?
I shall try to make a small beginning in the consideration of these 
questions in the next Iccture.

The Place of the Individual 
in the New World of 
the Behavioral Sciences
I
N t h e  pr e c ed in g l e c t u r e I endeavored to point out, in a very 
sketchy manner, the advances of the behavioral sciences in their 
ability to predict and control behavior. I tried to suggest the new 
world into which we will be advancing at an evermore headlong 
pace. Today I want to consider the question of how we — as in­
dividuals, as groups, as a culture — will live in, will respond to, will 
adapt to, this brave new world. W hat stance will we take in the face 
of these new developments?
I am going to describe two answers which have been given to this 
question, and then I wish to suggest some considerations which may 
lead to a third answer.
D e n y  a n d Ig n o re
One attitude which we can take is to deny that these scientific ad­
vances are taking place, and simply take the view that there can be 
no study of human behavior which is truly scientific. We can hold 
that the human animal cannot possibly take an objective attitude 
toward himself, and that therefore no real science of behavior can 
exist. W e can say that man is always a free agent, in some sense that 
384

The Place of the Individual
385
makes scientific study of his behavior impossible. N ot long ago, at 
a conference on the social sciences, curiously enough, I heard a well 
known economist take just this view. And one of this country’s 
most noted theologians writes, “ In any event, no scientific investiga­
tion of past behavior can become the basis of predictions of future 
behavior.” (3, p. 47)
The attitude of the general public is somewhat similar. Without 
necessarily denying the possibility of a behavioral science, the man in 
the street simply ignores the developments which are taking place. 
T o be sure he becomes excited for a time when he hears it said that 
the Communists have attempted to change the soldiers they have cap­
tured, by means of “brainwashing.” He may show a mild reaction 
of annoyance to the revelations of a book such as W hyte’s (13) 
which shows how heavily, and in what manipulative fashion, the 
findings of the behavioral sciences are used by modern industrial 
corporations. But by and large he sees nothing in all this to be con­
cerned about, any more than he did in the first theoretical statements 
that the atom could be split.
W e may, if we wish, join him in ignoring the problem. W e may 
go further, like the older intellectuals I have cited, and looking at the 
bchavorial sciences may declare that “there ain’t no such animal.” 
But since these reactions do not seem particularly intelligent I shall 
leave them to describe a much more sophisticated and much more 
prevalent point of view.
T h e F o r m u l a t io n  o f H u m a n  L if e  in T e r m s o f S c ie n c e 
Among behavioral scientists it seems to be largely taken for 
granted that the findings of such science will be used in the predic­
tion and control of human behavior. Yet most psychologists and 
other scientists have given little thought to what this would mean. 
An exception to this general tendency is Dr. B. F . Skinner of Har­
vard who has been quite explicit in urging psychologists to use the 
powers of control which they have in the interest of creating a better 
world. In an attempt to show what he means Dr. Skinner wrote a 
book some years ago entitled Walden Tw o (12), in which he gives 
a fictional account of what he regards as a Utopian community in 
which the learnings of the behavioral sciences arc fully utilized in all

386
T h e B e h a v io ra l S c ie n c e s a nd t h e P erso n
aspects of life — marriage, child rearing, ethical conduct, work, play, 
and artistic endeavor. I shall quote from his writings several times.
There are also some writers of fiction who have seen the signifi­
cance of the coming influence of the behavioral sciences. Aldous 
Huxley, in his Brave New  W orld (1), has given a horrifying picture 
of saccharine happiness in a scientifically managed world, against 
which man eventually revolts. George Orwell, in 1984 (5), has 
drawn a picture of the world created by dictatorial power, in which 
the behavioral sciences are used as instruments of absolute control 
of individuals so that not behavior alone but even thought is con­
trolled.
The writers of science fiction have also played a role in visualizing 
for us some of the possible developments in a world where behavior 
and personality are as much the subject of science as chemical com­
pounds or electrical impulses.
I should like to try to present, as well as I can, a simplified picture 
of the cultural pattern which emerges if we endeavor to shape human 
life in terms of the behavioral sciences.
There is first of all the recognition, almost the assumption, that 
scientific knowledge is the power to manipulate. Dr. Skinner says: 
“W e must accept the fact that some kind of control of human affairs 
is inevitable. W e cannot use good sense in human affairs unless some­
one engages in the design and construction of environmental condi­
tions which affect the behavior of men. Environmental changes have 
always been the condition for the improvement of cultural patterns, 
and wre can hardly use the more effective methods of science without 
making changes on a grander scale. . . . Science has turned up dan­
gerous processes and materials before. T o  use the facts and tech­
niques of a science of man to the fullest extent without making some 
monstrous mistake will be difficult and obviously perilous. It is no 
time for self-deception, emotional indulgence, or the assumption of 
attitudes which are no longer useful.” (10, p. 56-57)
The next assumption is that such power to control is to be used. 
Skinner sees it as being used benevolently, though he recognizes the 
danger of its being misused. Huxley sees it as being used with be­
nevolent intent, but actually creating a nightmare. Orwell describes 
the results if such power is used malignantly, to enhance the degree 
of regulation exercised by a dictatorial government.

The Place of the Individual
387
S t e p s in  t h e P ro cess
Let us look at some of the elements which are involved in the con­
cept of the control of human behavior as mediated by the behavioral 
sciences. W hat would be the steps in the process by which a society 
might organize itself so as to formulate human life in terms of the 
science of man?
First would come the selection of goals. In a recent paper Dr. 
Skinner suggests that one possible goal to be assigned to the be­
havioral technology is this: “Let man be happy, informed, skillful, 
well-behaved, and productive” (10, p. 47). In his Walden Two, 
where he can use the guise of fiction to express his views, he becomes 
more expansive. His hero says, “ Well, what do you say to the de­
sign of personalities? W ould that interest you? The control of 
temperament? Give me the specifications, and I’ll give you the man! 
What do you say to the control of motivation, building the interests 
which will make men most productive and most successful? Does 
that seem to you fantastic? Yet some of the techniques are available, 
and more can be worked out experimentally. Think of the possibili­
ties! . . . Let us control the lives of our children and see what we 
can make of them.” (12, p. 243)
W hat Skinner is essentially saying here is that the current knowl­
edge in the behavioral sciences plus that which the future will bring, 
will enable us to specify, to a degree which today would seem in­
credible, the kind of behavioral and personality results which we 
wisli to achieve. This is obviously both an opportunity and a very 
heavy burden.
The second element in this process would be one which is familiar 
to every scientist who has worked in the field of applied science. 
Given the purpose, the goal, we proceed by the method of science — 
by controlled experimentation — to discover the means to these 
ends. If for example our present knowledge of the conditions which 
cause men to be productive is limited, further investigation and ex­
perimentation would surely lead us to new knowledge in this field. 
And still further work will provide us with the knowledge of even 
more effective means. The method of science is self-correcting in 
thus arriving at increasingly effective ways of achieving the purpose 
we have selected.

388
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s and t h e  P * kson
The third element in the control of human behavior through the 
behavioral scicnccs involves the question of power. As the condi­
tions or methods are discovered by which to achieve our goal, some 
person or group obtains the powder to establish those conditions or 
use those methods. There has been too little recognition of the prob­
lem involved in this. T o  hope that the power being made available 
by the behavioral sciences will be exercised by the scientists, or by 
a benevolent group, seems to me a hope little supported by either re­
cent or distant history. It seems far more likely that behavioral sci­
entists, holding their present attitudes, will be in the position of the 
German rocket scientists specializing in guided missiles. First they 
worked devotedly for Hitler to destroy Russia and the United 
States. N ow  depending on who captured them, they work de­
votedly for Russia in the interest of destroying the United States, 
or devotedly for the United States in the interest of destroying Rus­
sia. If behavioral scientists are concerned solely with advancing 
their science, it seems most probable that they will serve the purposes 
of w hatever individual or group has the powr
er.
But this is, in a sense a digression. The main point of this view is 
that some person or group will have and use the power to put into 
effect the methods w7
hich have been discovered for achieving the 
desired goal.
The fourth step in this process whereby a society might formulate 
its life in terms of the behavioral sciences is the exposure of indi­
viduals to the methods and conditions mentioned. As individuals are 
exposed to the prescribed conditions this leads, with a high degree 
of probability, to the behavior which has been desired. Men then be­
come productive, if that has been the goal, or submissive, or what­
ever it has been decided to make them.
T o give something of the flavor of this aspect of the process as 
seen by one of its advocates, let me again quote the hero of Walden 
Two. “N ow  that we know how positive reinforcement works, and 
why negative doesn’t” he says, commenting on the method he is 
advocating, “ we can be more deliberate and hence more successful, 
in our cultural design. W e can achieve a sort of control under which 
the controlled, though they are following a code much more scrupu­
lously than was ever the case under the old system, nevertheless feel

The Place of the Individual
389
free. They are doing what they want to do, not what they are 
forced to do. That’s the sourcc of the tremendous power of positive 
reinforcement — there’s no restraint and no revolt. By a careful de­
sign, we control not the fin.il behavior, but the inclination to behave
— the motives, the desires, the wishes. The curious thing is that in 
that case the question of freedom never arises.” ( 12, p. 218)
T h e P ic t u r e and I t ’s I m p l ic a t io n s
Let me see if I can sum up verv briefly the picture of the impact of 
the behavioral sciences upon the individual and upon society, as this 
impact is explicitly seen by Dr. Skinner, and implied in the attitudes 
and work of many, perhaps most, behavioral scientists. Behavioral 
science is clearly moving forward; the increasing power for control 
which it gives will be held by some one or some group; such an in­
dividual or group will surely choose the purposes or goals to be 
achieved; and most of us will then be increasingly controlled by 
means so subtle we will not even be aware of them as controls. Thus 
whether a council of wise psychologists (if this is not a contradiction 
in terms) or a Stalin or a Big Brother has the power, and whether the 
goal is happiness, or productivity, or resolution of the Oedipus com­
plex, or submission, or love of Big Brother, we will inevitably find 
ourselves moving toward the chosen goal, and probably thinking 
that we ourselves desire it. Thus if this line of reasoning is correct, 
it appears that some form of completely controlled society — a 
Walden Tw o or a 1984 — is coming. The fact that is would surely 
arrive piecemeal rather than all at once, does not greatly change the 
fundamental issues. Alan and his behavior would become a planned 
product of a scientific society.
You may well ask, “But what about individual freedom? What 
about the democratic concepts of the rights of the individual?” 
Here too Dr. Skinner is quite specific. He says quite bluntly. “The 
hypothesis that man is not free is essential to the application of scien­
tific method to the study of human behavior. The free inner man 
who is held responsible for the behavior of the external biological 
organism is only a prc-scientific substitute for the kinds of causes 
which are discovered in the course of a scientific analysis. All these 
alternative causes lie outside the individual.” (11, p. 447)

390
T he B e h a v io r a l S c ie n c e s  a n d  t h e  P e rso n
In another source he explains this at somewhat more length. “As 
the use of science increases, we are forced to accept the theoretical 
structure with which science represents its facts. The difficulty is 
that this structure is clearly at odds with the traditional democratic 
conception of man. Every discovery of an event which has a part 
in shaping a man’s behavior seems to leave so much the less to be 
credited to the man himself; and as such explanations become more 
and more comprehensive, the contribution which may be claimed 
by the individual himself appears to approach zero. Man’s vaunted 
creative powers, his original accomplishments in art, science and 
morals, his capacity to choose and our right to hold him responsible 
for the consequences of his choice — none of these is conspicuous 
in this new self-portrait. Man, we once believed, was free to express 
himself in art, music and literature, to inquire into nature, to seek 
salvation in his own way. He could initiate action and make spon­
taneous and capricious changes of course. Under the most extreme 
duress some sort of choice remained to him. He could resist any 
effort to control him, though it might cost him his life. But science 
insists that action is initiated by forces impinging upon the individual, 
and that caprice is only another name for behavior for which we 
have not yet found a cause.” (10, p. 52-53)
The democratic philosophy of human nature and of government 
is seen by Skinner as having served a useful purpose at one time. “In 
rallying men against tyranny it wras necessary that the individual be 
strengthened, that he be taught that he had rights and could govern 
himself. T o give the common man a new conception of his worth, 
his dignity, and his power to save himself, both here and hereafter, 
was often the only resource of the revolutionist.” (10, p. 53) He 
regards this philosophy as being now out of date and indeed an 
obstacle “ if it prevents us from applying to human affairs the science 
of man.” (10, p. 54)
A  P er so n a l R ea c tio n
I have endeavored, up to this point, to give an objective picture 
of some of the developments in the behavioral sciences, and an ob­
jective picture of the kind of society which might emerge out of 
these developments. I do however have strong personal reactions

The Place of the Individual
391
to the kind of world I have been describing, a world which Skinner 
explicitly (and many other scientists implicitly) expect and hope for 
in the future. T o me this kind of world would destroy the human 
person as I have come to know him in the deepest moments of 
psychotherapy. In such moments I am in relationship with a person 
who is spontaneous, who is responsibly free, that is, aware of this 
freedom to choose who he will be, and aware also of the conse­
quences of his choice. T o believe, as Skinner holds, that all this is 
an illusion, and that spontaneity, freedom, responsibility, and choice 
have no real existence, would be impossible for me.
I feel that to the limit of my ability I have played my part in ad­
vancing the behavioral sciences, but if the result of my efforts and 
those of others is that man becomes a robot, created and controlled 
by a science of his own making, then I am very unhappy indeed. If 
the good life of the future consists in so conditioning individuals 
through the control of their environment, and through the control 
of the rewards they receive, that they will be inexorably productive, 
well-behaved, happy or whatever, then I want none of it. T o  me 
this is a pseudo-form of the good life which includes everything 
save that which makes it good.
And so I ask myself, is there any flaw in the logic of this develop­
ment? Is there any alternative view as to what the behavioral sci­
ences might mean to the individual and to society? It seems to me 
that I perceive such a flaw, and that I can conceive of an alternative 
view. These I would like to set before you.
E nds and V a l u e s in  R e l a t io n to S c ie n c e
It seems to me that the view I have presented rests upon a faulty 
perception of the relationship of goals and values to the enterprise 
of science. The significance of the purpose of a scientific undertak­
ing is, I believe, grossly underestimated. I would like to state a two­
pronged thesis which in my estimation deserves consideration. Then 
I will elaborate the meaning of these two points.
1. In any scientific endeavor — whether “pure” or applied science
— there is a prior personal subjective choice of the purpose or value 
which that scientific work is perceived as serving.
2. This subjective value choice which brings the scientific en­

392
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s a nd t h e P e r so n
deavor into being must always lie outside of that endeavor, and can 
never become a part of the science involved in that endeavor.
Let me illustrate the first point from Dr. Skinner’s writings. When 
he suggests that the task for the behavioral sciences is to make man 
“productive,” “ well-behaved,” etc., it is obvious that he is making 
a choice. He might have chosen to make men submissive, dependent, 
and gregarious, for example. Yet by his own statement in another 
context man’s “ capacity to choose,” his freedom to select his course 
and to initiate action — these powers do not exist in the scientific 
picture of man. Here is, I believe, the deep-seated contradiction, or 
paradox. Let me spell it out as clearly as I can.
Science, to be sure, rests on the assumption that behavior is 
caused — that a specified event is followed by a consequent event. 
Hence all is determined, nothing is free, choice is impossible. But 
we must recall that scicnce itself, and each specific scientific en­
deavor, each changc of course in a scientific research, each inter­
pretation of the meaning of a scicntific finding and each decision as 
to how the finding shall be applied, rests upon a personal subjective 
choice. Thus science in general exists in the same paradoxical situa­
tion as docs Dr. Skinner. A personal subjcctivc choice made by man 
sets in motion the operations of science, which in time proclaims 
that there can be no such thing as a personal subjective choice. I shall 
make some comments about this continuing paradox at a later point.
I stressed the fact that each of these choices initiating or further­
ing the scientific venture, is a value choice. The scientist investigates 
this rather than that, bccause he feels the first investigation has more 
value for him. He chooses one method for his study rather than 
another because he values it more highly. He interprets his findings 
in one w ay rather than another because he believes the first way is 
closer to the truth, or more valid —  in other words that it is closer 
to a criterion which he values. N ow  these value choices are never 
a part of the scicntific venture itself. The value choiccs connected 
with a particular scientific enterprise always and necessarily lie out­
side of that enterprise.
1 wish to make it clear that I am not saying that values cannot be 
included as a subject of science. It is not true that science deals only 
with certain classes of “facts” and that these classes do not include

The Place of the Individual
393
values. It is a bit more complex than that, as a simple illustration or 
two may make clear.
If I value knowledge of the “ three R ’s” as a goal of education, the 
methods of science can give me increasingly accurate information 
as to how this goal may be achieved. If I value problem-solving 
ability as a goal of education, the scientific method can give me the 
same kind of help.
N ow  if I wish to determine whether problem-solving ability is 
“better” than knowledge of the three R’s, then scientific method can 
also study those two values, but only —  and this is very important
— only in terms of some other value which I have subjectively 
chosen. I may value college success. Then I can determine whether 
problem-solving ability or knowledge of the three R ’s is most 
closely associated with that value. I may value personal integration 
or vocational success or responsible citizenship. I can determine 
whether problem-solving ability or knowledge of the three R ’s is 
“better” for achieving any one of these values. But the value or 
purpose which gives meaning to a particular scientific endeavor 
must always lie outside of that endeavor.
Though our concern in these lectures is largely with applied sci­
ence what I have been saying seems equally true of so-called pure 
science. In pure science the usual prior subjective value choice is the 
discovery of truth. But this is a subjective choice, and science c?n 
never say whether it is the best choice, save in the light of some other 
value. Geneticists in Russia, for example, had to make a subjective 
choice of whether it was better to pursue truth, or to discover facts 
which upheld a governmental dogma. Which choice is “better” ? 
W e could make a scientific investigation of those alternatives, but 
only in the light of some other subjectively chosen value. If, for 
example, we value the survival of a culture then we could begin to 
investigate with the methods of science the question as to whether 
pursuit of truth or support of governmental dogma is most closely 
associated with cultural survival.
M y point then is that any scientific endeavor, pure or applied, is 
carried on in the pursuit of a purpose or value which is subjectively 
chosen by persons. It is important that this choice be made explicit, 
since the particular value which is being sought can never be tested

394
T h e B e h a v io ra l S c ie n c e s an d t h e  P e r so n
or evaluated, confirmed or denied, by the scientific endeavor to 
which it gives birth and meaning. The initial purpose or value 
always and necessarily lies outside the scope of the scientific effort 
which it sets in motion.
Among other things this means that if we choose some particular 
goal or series of goals for human beings, and then set out on a large 
scale to control human behavior to the end of achieving those goals, 
we are locked in the rigidity of our initial choice, because such a 
scientific endeavor can never transcend itself to select new goals. 
Only subjective human persons can do that. Thus if we choose as 
our goal the state of happiness for human beings (a goal deservedly 
ridiculed by Aldous Huxley in Brave N ew  W orld), and if we in­
volved all of society in a successful scientific program by which 
people became happy, we would be locked in a colossal rigidity in 
which no one would be free to question this goal, because our 
scientific operations could not transcend themselves to question their 
guiding purposes. And without laboring this point, I wT
ould remark 
that colossal rigidity, whether in dinosaurs or dictatorships, has a 
very poor record of evolutionary survival.
If, however, a part of our scheme is to set free some “planners” 
wrho do not have to be happy, who are not controlled, and who 
are therefore free to choose other values, this has several meanings. 
It means that the purpose we have chosen as our goal is not a suffi­
cient and satisfying one for human beings, but must be supplemented. 
It also means that if it is necessary to set up an elite group which 
is free, then this shows all too clearly that the great majority are only 
the slaves — no matter by w^hat high-sounding name wr
e call them
— of those who select the goals.
Perhaps, however, the thought is that a continuing scientific en­
deavor will evolve its own goals; that the initial findings will alter 
the directions, and subsequent findings will alter them still further 
and that the science somehow develops its own purpose. This seems 
to be a view implicitly held by many scientists. It is surely a reason­
able description, but it overlooks one element in this continuing 
development, which is that subjective personal choice enters in at 
every point at which the direction changes. The findings of a 
science, the results of an experiment, do not and never can tell us

The Place of the Individual
395
what next scientific purpose to pursue. Even in the purest of science, 
the scientist must decide what the findings mean, and must subjec­
tively choose what next step will be most profitable in the pursuit of 
his purpose. And if we are speaking of the application of scientific 
knowledge, then it is distressingly clear that the increasing scientific 
knowledge of the structure of the atom carries with it no necessary 
choice as to the purpose to which this knowledge will be put. This 
is a subjective personal choice which must be made by many in­
dividuals.
Thus I return to the proposition with which I began this section 
of my remarks —  and which I now repeat in different words. Sci­
ence has its meaning as the objective pursuit of a purpose which has 
been subjectively chosen by a person or persons. This purpose or 
value can never be investigated by the particular scientific experi­
ment or investigation to which it has given birth and meaning. 
Consequently, any discussion of the control of human beings by 
the behavioral sciences must first and most deeply concern itself 
with the subjectively chosen purposes which such an application of 
science is intended to implement.
A n  A l t e r n a t i v e  S e t  o f  V a l u e s
If the line of reasoning I have been presenting is valid, then it opens 
new doors to us. If we frankly face the fact that science takes off 
from a subjectively chosen set of values, then we are free to select 
the values we wish to pursue. W e are not limited to such stultifying 
goals as producing a controlled state of happiness, productivity, and 
the like. I would like to suggest a radically different alternative.
Suppose we start with a set of ends, values, purposes, quite dif­
ferent from the type of goals we have been considering. Suppose we 
do this quite openly, setting them forth as a possible value choice 
to be accepted or rejected. Suppose we select a set of values which 
focuses on fluid elements of process, rather than static attributes. 
We might then value:
Alan as a process of becoming; as a process of achieving worth and 
dignity through the development of his potentialities;
The individual human being as a self-actualizing process, moving 
on to more challenging and enriching experiences;

396
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s and t h e  P erso n
The process by which the individual creatively adapts to an ever- 
new and changing world;
The process by which knowledge transcends itself, as for example 
the theory of relativity transcended Newtonian physics, itself to be 
transcended in some future day by a new perception.
If we sclect values such as these we turn to our science and tech­
nology of behavior with a very different set of questions. W e will 
want to know such things as these:
Can science aid us in the discovery of new modes of richly re­
warding living? More meaningful and satisfying modes of interper­
sonal relationships?
Can science inform us as to how the human race can become a 
more intelligent participant in its own evolution —  its physical, 
psychological and social evolution?
Can science inform us as to ways of releasing the creative capacity 
of individuals, which seem so necessary if we are to survive in this 
fantastically expanding atomic age? Dr. Oppcnhcimer has pointed 
out (4) that knowledge, which used to double in millcnia or cen­
turies, now doubles in a generation or a decade. It appears that we 
will need to discover the utmost in release of creativity if we are 
to be able to adapt effectively.
In short, can science discover the methods by which man can 
most readily become a continually developing and self-transcending 
process, in his behavior, his thinking, his knowledge? Can science 
predict and release an essentially “ unpredictable” freedom?
It is one of the virtues of science as a method that it is as able 
to advance and implement goals and purposes of this sort as it is to 
serve static values such as states of being well-informed, happy, 
obedient. Indeed we have some evidence of this.
A S m a l l  E x a m p l e
I will perhaps be forgiven if I document some of the possibilities 
along this line by turning to psychotherapy, the field I know best.
Psychotherapy, as Mccrloo (2) and others have pointed out, can 
be one of the most subtle tools for the control of one person by an­
other. The therapist can subtly mold individuals in imitation of 
himself. He can cause an individual to become a submissive and 
conforming being. When certain therapeutic principles are used in

The Place of the Individual
397
extreme fashion, vve call it brainwashing, an instance of the disinte­
gration of the personality and a reformulation of the person along 
lines desired by the controlling individual. So the principles of 
therapy can be used as a most effective means of external control 
of human personality and behavior. Can psychotherapy be anything 
else?
Here I find the developments going on in client-centered psycho­
therapy (8) an exciting hint of what a behavioral scicnce can do in 
achieving the kinds of values I have stated. Quite aside from being 
a somewhat new orientation in psychotherapy, this development 
has important implications regarding the relation of a behavioral 
science to the control of human behavior. Let me describe our 
experience as it relates to the issues of the present discussion.
In client-centered therapy, we are deeply engaged in the predic­
tion and influencing of behavior. As therapists we institute certain 
attitudinal conditions, and the client has relatively little voice in the 
establishment of these conditions. Very briefly we have found that 
the therapist is most effective if he is: (a) genuine, integrated, 
transparently real in the relationship; (b) acccptant of the client as 
a separate, different, person, and acccptant of each fluctuating as­
pect of the client as it comes to expression; and (c) sensitively 
empathic in his understanding, seeing the world through the client’s 
eyes. Our research permits us to predict that if these attitudinal 
conditions are instituted or established, certain behavioral conse­
quences will ensue. Putting it this way sounds as if we arc again 
back in the familiar groove of being able to prcdict behavior, and 
hence able to control it. But precisely here exists a sharp difference.
The conditions we have chosen to establish predict such be­
havioral consequences as these: that the client will become more 
self-directing, less rigid, more open to the evidence of his senses, 
better organized and integrated, more similar to the ideal which he 
has chosen for himself. In other words we have established by ex­
ternal control conditions which we predict will be followed by 
internal control by the individual, in pursuit of internally chosen 
goals. W e have set the conditions which prcdict various classes of 
behaviors — sclf-dirccting behaviors, sensitivity to realities within 
and without, flexible adaptiveness — which are by their very nature 
unpredictable in their specifics. The conditions we have established

398
T h e B eh a v io ra l S c ie n c e s a nd t h e P erso n
predict behavior which is essentially “ free.” Our recent research 
(9) indicates that our predictions are to a significant degree corrob­
orated, and our commitment to the scientific method causes us to 
believe that more effective means of achieving these goals may be 
realized.
Research exists in other fields — industry, education, group dy­
namics — which seems to support our own findings. I believe it may 
be conservatively stated that scientific progress has been made in 
identifying those conditions in an interpersonal relationship which, 
if they exist in B, are followed in A  by greater maturity in behavior, 
less dependence upon others, an increase in expressiveness as a per­
son, an increase in variability, flexibility and effectiveness of adapta­
tion, an increase in self-responsibility and self-direction. And quite 
in contrast to the concern expressed by some we do not find that 
the creatively adaptive behavior which results from such self-di­
rected variability of expression is too chaotic or too fluid. Rather, 
the individual who is open to his experience, and self-directing, is 
harmonious, not chaotic, ingenious rather than random, as he orders 
his responses imaginatively toward the achievement of his own pur­
poses. His creative actions are no more a chaotic accident than was 
Einstein’s development of the theory of relativity.
Thus we find ourselves in fundamental agreement with John 
Dewey’s statement: “Science has made its way by releasing, not by 
suppressing, the elements of variation, of invention and innovation, 
of novel creation in individuals.” 
(7, p. 359) W e have come to 
believe that progress in personal life and in group living is made in 
the same way, by releasing variation, freedom, creativity.
A  P o s s i b l e  C o n c e p t  o f  t h e  C o n t r o l  o f  H u m a n  B e h a v io r
It is quite clear that the point of view I am expressing is in sharp 
contrast to the usual conception of the relationship of the behavioral 
sciences to the control of human behavior, previously mentioned. 
In order to make this contrast even more blunt, I will state this pos­
sibility in a form parallel to the steps which I described before.
1. 
It is possible for us to choose to value man as a self-actualizing 
process of becoming; to value creativity, and the process by which 
knowledge becomes self-transcending.

The Place of the Individual
399
2. We can procccd, by the methods of science, to discover the 
conditions which necessarily precede these processes, and through 
continuing experimentation, to discover better means of achieving 
these purposes.
3. It is possible for individuals or groups to set these conditions, 
with a minimum of power or control. According to present knowl­
edge, the only authority necessary is the authority to establish cer­
tain qualities of interpersonal relationship.
4. Exposed to these conditions, present knowledge suggests that 
individuals become more self-responsible, make progress in self- 
actualization, become more flexible, more unique and varied, more 
creatively adaptive.
5. Thus such an initial choice would inaugurate the beginnings 
of a social system or subsystem in which values, knowledge, adap­
tive skills, and even the concept of science would be continually 
changing and self-transcending. The emphasis would be upon man 
as a process of becoming.
I believe it is clear that such a view as I have been describing 
does not lead to any definable Utopia. It would be impossible to 
predict its final outcome. It involves a step by step development, 
based upon a continuing subjective choice of purposes, which are 
implemented by the behavioral sciences. It is in the direction of the 
“open society,” as that term has been defined by Popper (6), where 
individuals carry responsibility for personal decisions. It is at the 
opposite pole from his conccpt of the closed society, of which 
Walden Tw o would be an example.
I trust it is also evident that the whole emphasis is upon process, 
not upon end states of being. I am suggesting that it is by choosing 
to value certain qualitative elements of the process of becoming, 
that we can find a pathway toward the open society.
T h e  C h o ic e
It is my hope that I have helped to clarify the range of choice 
which will lie before us and our children in regard to the behavioral 
sciences. We can choose to use our growing knowledge to enslave

400
T iie B e h a v io r a l S c ie n c e s  a n d  t h e  P e rso n
people in ways never dreamed of before, depersonalizing them, 
controlling them by means so carefully selected that they will per­
haps never be aware of their loss of personhood. W e can choose to 
utilize our scientific knowledge to make men necessarily happy, well- 
behaved, and productive, as Dr. Skinner suggests. W e can, if we 
wish, choose to make men submissive, conforming, docile. Or at 
the other end of the spectrum of choice we can choose to use the 
behavioral sciences in ways which will free, not control; which 
will bring about constructive variability, not conformity; which will 
develop creativity, not contentment; which will facilitate each 
person in his self-directed process of becoming; which will aid 
individuals, groups, and even the concept of science, to become self- 
transcending in freshly adaptive ways of meeting life and its prob­
lems. The choice is up to us, and the human race being what it is, 
we are likely to stumble about, making at times some nearly dis­
astrous value choices, and at other times highly constructive ones.
If we choose to utilize our scientific knowledge to free men, then 
it will demand that we live openly and frankly with the great para­
dox of the behavioral sciences. We will recognize that behavior, 
when examined scientifically, is surely best understood as determined 
by prior causation. This is the great fact of science. But responsible 
personal choice, which is the most essential clement in being a per­
son, which is the core experience in psychotherapy, which exists 
prior to any scientific endeavor, is an equally prominent fact in our 
lives. We will have to live with the realization that to deny the real­
ity of the experience of responsible personal choice is as stultifying, 
as closed-minded, as to deny the possibility of a behavioral science. 
That these two important elements of our experience appear to be 
in contradiction has perhaps the same significance as the contradic­
tion between the wave theory and the corpuscular theory of light, 
both of which can be shown to be true, even though incompatible. 
W e cannot profitably deny our subjective life, any more than we 
can deny the objective description of that life.
In conclusion then, it is my contention that science cannot come 
into being without a personal choice of the values we wish to achieve. 
And these values we choose to implement will forever lie outside 
of the science which implements them; the goals we select, the

The Place of the Individual
401
purposes we wish to follow, must always be outside of the science 
which achieves them. T o  me this has the encouraging meaning that 
the human person, with his capacity of subjective choice, can and 
will always exist, separate from and prior to any of his scientific 
undertakings. Unless as individuals and groups we choose to relin­
quish our capacity of subjective choice, we will always remain free 
persons, not simply pawns of a self-created behavioral science.

CARL R. ROGERS
ON BECOMING A PERSON
In the few years since it was first published, this study of 
personal growth and creativity by one of America’s most 
distinguished psychologists has established itself as a 
classic work, one that challenges many concepts and atti­
tudes of traditional psychology, and poses such fundamental 
questions as:What is the meaning of personal growth?.Under 
what conditions is growth possible? How can one person 
help another? What is creativity and how can it be fostered?
Contemporary psychology derives largely from the experi­
mental laboratory or from Freudian theory. It is thus largely 
preoccupied with minute aspects of animal and human be­
havior, or with the mentally ill. Dr. Rogers believes that 
psychology and psychiatry should set their sights higher, and 
be more concerned with growth and the potential in man. 
It is to this end that Dr. Rogers’ famous “ client-centered 
therapy” is directed. The focus of this therapy is not on 
methodology, but on the person as an individual, with all 
his various qualities and possibilities infinitely capable of 
development.
This philosophical and provocative book is a summing up of 
Dr. Rogers^ mature experience in psychotherapy, it is an in­
dispensable introduction to the process of becoming, in­
tended not only for. psychologists and psychiatrists, but for 
all who are interested in human personality and growth.
