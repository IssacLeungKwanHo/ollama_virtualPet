# ollama_trial

I made 2 ollama bots here (one call api, one can run locally). Noted that you can't find .env here (it means no API key). 

API_Ollama.py is for running the Ollama using the Hugging Face API.

Local_Ollama.py is for running the Ollama locally.


For the virtual pet, the cat is from https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-cat-sprites (Credit to Elthen's Pixel Art Shop for the virtual pet sprite sheet).
